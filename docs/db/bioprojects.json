These waste products include materials such as petroleum based products (e.g., plastics, fuels, lubricants, etc.), paper based products, and other organic contaminants commonly removed and treated at municipal wastewater treatment plants. The low temperatures in arctic regions represent a significant challenge for established wastewater treatment methods that depend on mesophilic temperatures.

    "description": "Global worming and climate change has been manifested in the decrease of the Arctic Ocean see ice extent and thickness. The thinner sea-ice regime that the Arctic has been facing changed Arctic’s primary productivity and biogeochemistry. Understanding the dynamics of the microbial communities that feed Arctic phytoplankton and biologically derived carbon export will be worthwhile in order to draw future trends. In this study we present a comprehensive analysis of the biogeographic patters of Arctic microbiome diversity and distribution along two oceanographic transects in the Marginal Ice Zone around Svalbard, within strong environmental gradients (Ripfjorden, Kongsfjorden). A total of 11 stations were sample at three depths (surface, chlorophyll maximum and bottom) during the Norwegian Polar Institute MOSJ-ICE 2016 plankton-monitoring program. Samples were concentrated on board through Sterivex 0.2 mm filtration and preserved at -80ºC for later DNA extraction. Amplification of 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes were performed and sequenced in Illumina MiSeq with a sequence depth of about 100 thousand read pairs. The prokaryotic and eukaryotic MOSJ-ICE16 data sets collection comprises highly complex and diverse microbial communities with a marked biogeographic pattern of distribution. Strong links were identified between bacterioplanckton and phytoplankton/picophytoplankton distribution driven by environmental and biogeochemical forces, most relevant to unravel the role of microbial pathways in supporting Arctic Ocean Primary productivity and system integrity.",

    "description": "The Arctic permafrost has been identified as a critical global tipping element in a warming climate. Coastal permafrost erosion releases between 5 and 14 Tg of organic carbon (OC) annually into the Arctic Ocean. Once discharged into the ocean and redeposited on the ocean floor, the fate of permafrost organic matter remains largely unclear. Despite its significant potential to release previously stored carbon back into the atmosphere, the process is accelerated by anthropogenic climate change. We quantified the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) composition and microbial community of nearshore sediments off Herschel Island in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Our data indicate that redeposited permafrost OC can be readily utilized in the subsurface. Considering the tremendous size of the eroding coastal permafrost reservoir even the conservative ~27% contribution may have a long-lasting effect on the global climate, increasing the climate crisis.",

These flavors were formed by nonstarter microorganisms which are introduced spontaneously from raw materials and cheese making environment. However, due to the diversity and complexity of microbiota and components that constitute ripened cheese, the overall relationship between flavor development and existing microorganisms remains unclear. In this study, bacterial microbiota analysis was conducted on soft-type smear-ripened cheese from Japan, revealing that Marinilactibacillus, which are halophilic and alkaliphilic marine lactic acid bacteria, were predominant. We isolated Marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans RV-2-3 strain from the same smear-ripened cheese used for the bacterial microbiota analysis and performed draft genome sequencing analysis of the strain. Furthermore, smear-ripened cheese was inoculated with the isolated strain, and the fluctuation in bacterial community and metabolite composition under storage conditions was observed, comparing the cheese without the strain.",

    "description": "Sequencing data relevant to the project \"Structural and functional studies of proteome encoded by three novel temperate DNA bacteriophages isolated from Antarctic soil\" (lzp-2022/1-0111). The sequencing data generated and analyzed within the scope of the project is expected to expand the current knowledge on the diversity of culturable bacteria from Antarctic soils and their phages.Previously, we retrieved three novel temperate bacteriophages and their host bacteria from the Antarctic soil samples collected during the first Latvian Antarctic Expedition. The current project mainly focuses on the elucidation of functions for evolutionarily conserved proteins of unknown function found in the proteome of the Psychrobacillus phage Perkons, Psychrobacillus phage Spoks, and Sporosarcina phage Lietuvens, which are the first cultured phages known to infect the representatives of the aforementioned bacterial genera. The novelty of phages made it interesting to elucidate the genomes of their hosts to enable phage-host interaction studies at a finer scale, as well as to expand the knowledge on the culturable Antarctic bacteria genomic diversity.Within the project, we have planned to perform the RNA sequencing of the phage+host systems at different time points after the infection to temporally resolve the transcriptome of the phages and see how the host responds to the infection. For this, we needed to obtain not only the complete annotated phage genomes (which were already publicly released by us through GenBank several years ago) but also sequence, assemble, and annotate the complete genomes of the host strains for the aforementioned phages. During the course of the project, we will release complete annotated genomes of the aforementioned novel bacterial isolates alongside the relevant Illumina (250 bp PE) and long-read (ONT) datasets that allowed us to assemble these complete genomes that will be annotated using PGAP.This BioProject will be used to make all the relevant sequencing data and assemblies related to this project publicly available without any restriction to reinforce the results and conclusions drawn from the sequencing part of the research performed within the lzp-2022/1-0111 project.",

We developed a low-temperature two-stage fermentation strategy, employing Bacillus subtilis during the aerobic phase and Lactobacillus plantarum during the anaerobic phase. This process markedly degraded soybean antigenic proteins and crude fiber, enhanced protein content and enzymatic activity, and inhibited the accumulation of harmful biogenic amines.High-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed that this fermentation strategy promoted a shift toward beneficial microbial dominance while suppressing pathogenic taxa. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that two-stage fermentation not only improves the nutritional and functional quality of pig feed but also ensures microbial safety.",

However, the identities and metabolic functions of these microbial populations are not well understood. In this study, we investigate translationally active microbial communities and elucidate their metabolic activity in hydrothermally impacted marine sediments. By combining activity measurements, amplicon sequencing, and metagenomics data, we improved our understanding of carbon transformations and microbial ecology of the deep biosphere. Our findings emphasize the ecological significance of heterotrophic microbes and the carbon-degrading metabolisms they use to survive in extreme conditions. This work advances the applications of next-generation physiology techniques to document single-cell metabolic activity in a high-throughput manner in the marine deep biosphere.",

    "title": "Plant and soil microbiome following glacier retreat",
    "description": "Glaciers are retreating at an accelerating rate due to global climate warming, profoundly reshaping alpine landscapes. As ice recedes, newly exposed forelands become natural laboratories to study primary succession and ecosystem development. These environments offer unique opportunities to understand how biodiversity colonizes and functions in response to rapid environmental change. In particular, glacier retreat has far-reaching consequences for microbial and plant communities and, consequently, for ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling and soil formation.In this project, we investigated how glacier retreat influences fungal and bacterial communities and their interactions with plants along a chronosequence spanning approximately 160 years of deglaciation. We sampled bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, and root endosphere from multiple plant species across four stages of deglaciation. Unlike many studies that focus on single plant species, we adopted a community-level approach, encompassing a broad diversity of co-occurring alpine plants to better capture the complexity of plant-microbe associations in these dynamic systems.Our study aimed to (1) characterize the composition and diversity of bacterial and fungal communities across different plant microhabitats (soil, rhizosphere, roots), (2) assess how these communities change along the temporal and spatial gradient of glacier retreat, and (3) reconstruct plant-bacteria and plant-fungi interaction networks to identify key drivers of microbial community assembly and ecosystem functioning. We examined both alpha-diversity (within-sample diversity) and beta-diversity (between-sample variation), as well as the distribution of functional groups associated with different stages of succession. We analyzed a total of 234 microbial communities using high-throughput sequencing approaches, enabling detailed insights into how microbial diversity and function evolve over time and space.Although soil microorganisms play a foundational role in ecological processes and ecosystem functions, they are often overlooked in conservation measures. It is therefore important to understand their fate in fast-changing environments, especially before the extinction of glaciers leads to their disappearance from Earth. Our study contributes to filling this knowledge gap by providing an integrative view of plant-microbe interactions along a glacier foreland. The results underscore the need to consider microbial communities in ecological models and conservation frameworks addressing the impacts of climate change on alpine ecosystems.",

    "description": "Biological aerosols serve as efficient ice-nucleating particles (INPs), driving the liquid-to-ice transition in clouds and thereby shaping cloud thickness, lifetime, albedo, and precipitation. Although atmospheric INPs are known to derive from terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments, their specific sources and microbial producers remain largely unresolved, especially in the rapidly warming Arctic. Here, we examine terrestrial runoff as a driver of INP enrichment during summer in Young Sound fjord, Northeast Greenland. INP concentrations active at -10 degC, were significantly elevated in the sea-surface microlayer (SML) and at river outlets relative to bulk seawater, correlating positively with freshwater input and negatively with salinity and distance from runoff. These patterns highlight terrestrial runoff as a major source of warm-temperature INPs. We further identify a novel mechanism of SML formation in Arctic coastal waters: direct accumulation of terrestrial particles and compounds at the surface due to density contrasts between fresh and seawater. Highly active biological INPs were also observed in the atmosphere (1.3-25.3 INP-10 m-3), with sequencing data suggesting terrestrial origins. Our findings demonstrate how terrestrial ecosystems enrich the coastal SML with biogenic INPs that are subsequently aerosolized, underscoring their importance for Arctic cloud processes under ongoing climate change.",

    "description": "The yearlong MOSAiC ice drift (October 2019 to September 2020), with the research vessel Polarstern serving as the base, started in the eastern Eurasian Basin and crossed the Amundsen and Nansen basins towards the Fram Strait (Fig. 1) (e.g. Nicolaus et al., 2022; Fong et al., 2024). One dedicated research project (Ridges - Safe HAVens for ice-associated flora and fauna in a seasonally ice-covered Arctic Ocean (HAVOC) (Granskog and Müller, 2024) performed detailed and interdisciplinary observations of ridges during MOSAiC. During the drift, three different ridges were sampled at different times of the year. The changes between ridges were necessary, as logistical challenges and ice dynamics prevented the sampling of the same ridge throughout the entire period. The first ridge (R1) was investigated in winter, the second ridge (R2) was investigated in spring, and the third ridge (R3) was investigated in summer. Ice cores for temperature and salinity measurements as well as biogeochemical variables were extracted with a 9-cm (Mark II) internal diameter ice corer (Kovacs Enterprise, USA). Ice cores collected for biogeochemical variables were cut into 10 cm long sections in the field and collected in sterile plastic bags, with the focus on the three habitats: the ice of the roof and the floor of water-filled voids, the bottom of the ridge, and, when present, the frozen void and algae inclusions. Biogeochemical variables were, when possible, derived from pooled ice core sections of three replicate cores (R3), and during challenging weather periods (R1 and R2) from single ice cores. The core sections were kept dark and cool, transferred to the lab on board and melted in the dark after the addition of filtered seawater: 50 mL 0.22 µm filtered seawater was added per cm of sea ice thickness, and the sea ice samples melted within 24–36 hours in the dark at around 4°C. When possible, the water (20–30 L) inside the voids, below the ridge and below level ice, was sampled using a manual bilge pump with a silicon tube with a diameter of 20 mm into prewashed polyethylene containers. Both melted sea ice and water samples were filtered through a Sterivex 0.22 µm filter or, when volumes were < 500 mL (three sea ice samples), onto 0.22 µm Durapore filters. The filters were directly flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at -80°C, and at the end of the campaign, shipped to the University of Bergen on dry ice. DNA from Sterivex filters was extracted using the Qiagen PowerWater DNA kit, and the DNA from Durapore filters was extracted using the QIAGEN DNeasy Power Soil kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted DNA was stored at -20°C until PCR amplification and prepared for paired-end MiSeq sequencing (Illumina, CA, USA) using a two-step PCR method to amplify the V4 region of the eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes (EukA7F, Euk570R) and the V4 region of the bacterial and archaeal 16SrRNA genes (519F, 806RB) before attaching MiSeq adapter and barcode sequences. Comparative 18S rRNA gene data from first-year and second-year level ice (FYI and SYI) and surface seawater used in this study are part of the MOSAiC main programme, obtained from the Alfred-Wegener institute and can be found at ENA under the project number PRJNA895866.",

However, AD performance at low temperatures is hindered by reduced microbial activity and biomass retention. To address these challenges, strategies such as magnetite-embedded granules (MEG) and advanced reactor designs have been explored to enhance microbial stability and electron transfer. Recently, integrating bioelectrochemical systems (BES) with AD, termed BEAD, has shown promise in improving methane yields and microbial activity under ambient conditions. This study investigates BEAD performance under low-temperature conditions using synthetic municipal wastewater, focusing on methane production, energy recovery, and microbial community dynamics.",

    "description": "Based on 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing technology, this study conducted a comparative analysis of the composition and functional differences of the intestinal microbiota between wild and captive tundra swans. The research found that the intestinal microbiota of the two groups of tundra swans were highly consistent at the phylum level, and the Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were both highly abundant in both groups, indicating that host genetic factors play a decisive role in the composition of intestinal microbiota. However, differences in diet and environment have driven significant microbiota differentiation, and the wild population presents a unique oligodominant microbiota structure. Functional analysis revealed that the wild population significantly enriched the pathways of \"cofactor and vitamin metabolism\" and \"porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism\". This study reveals the ecological mechanism by which tundra swans adapt to the environment through the interaction of \"diet - microbiome - host\", providing a scientific basis at the microbiome level for the protection and captive management of wild birds.",

    "description": "Comparative studies of microbial communities occupying different body sites in wild vertebrates are scarce, but they are crucial for advancing our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary factors shaping animal microbiomes. We therefore used a “natural experiment” comprising mother-offspring pairs from two adjacent Antarctic fur seal breeding colonies that differ in social density to investigate differences between skin and gut microbial communities in relation to host-specific and environmental factors. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we uncovered a strong influence of colony on the diversity and composition of skin but not gut microbial communities. Specifically, we observed a suppressive effect of high social density on skin microbial alpha diversity as well as an overabundance of phyla associated with diseases and bite wounds in the high-density colony. Our findings suggest that skin microbial communities may be more sensitive to external factors, whereas gut communities are more tightly regulated by the host. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering multiple body sites and their distinct microbial communities to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the factors shaping microbial diversity and composition in marine mammals.",

    "description": "Cold seeps, unique deep-sea ecosystems driven by hydrocarbon- and sulfide-rich fluid fluxes, support mesopelagic fish communities. Fish gut microbiota are vital to host metabolism and health, and interact closely with surrounding water environment. However, information on gut bacterial composition and potential functional profiles of mesopelagic fishes in the cold seep has rarely been explored. In this study, high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to compare gut microbiota of mesopelagic fishes collected in the cold seep environment and outside the cold seep environment . Significant differences were found in gut bacterial composition and predicted functional profiles between the two distinct fish habitats. The genera Blastopirellula, Ruegeria, and Rubripirellula, which are involved in sulfide and hydrocarbon transformations, were significantly more abundant in cold seep fish. In contrast, Acinetobacter was significantly enriched in fish outside the cold seep. The difference of gut bacterial composition between the two habitats were primarily driven by the abundan subcommunities. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed more complex gut microbiome networks in cold seep fishes, characterized by higher node degree and connectivity but lower modularity. Together, these findings demonstrate that the cold seep environment strongly shapes both the structure and metabolic potential of mesopelagic fish gut microbiota, and highlight gut microbial contributions to host adaptation in chemosynthesis-based habitats.",

At the same time, DBP can enter the human body through the food chain, affecting the normal development and metabolic function of human beings, while the normal operation of the immune system, reproductive system and endocrine system will also be affected. In serious cases, it has three effects on human beings and future generations. Due to its stable chemical structure in the natural environment, the degradation efficiency of DBP by photocatalysis and microorganisms in nature is low. However, the agricultural development area in Northeast China is in a cold climate, and the daily light time is lower than that in other areas. The degradation efficiency of DBP by soil protozoa is very low, and the black soil has been polluted by DBP for a long time, which has greatly restricted the local agricultural development. Because the process of physical adsorption and chemical catalysis of DBP is cumbersome and inefficient, it is one of the most innovative and promising technologies to apply exogenous microorganisms to the soil for efficient, green and rapid degradation of DBP by microbial remediation",

    "description": "This project contains 16S files used to analyze the seawater conditions in which larval Strongylocentrotus purpuratus were raised. Shaping of the epigenomic landscape by local environments during early life stages could initiate adaptive plasticity, allowing developing organisms to optimize their phenotypes for local conditions. Elevated seawater temperature, in addition to being an independent stressor, can alter marine microbial communities, leading to increased bacterial loads and pathogen spread, making it imperative to understand how plasticity in physiological and molecular traits of marine organisms are impacted, especially the immune system. We examined how early developmental exposure to elevated temperature and host-associated microbes influence larval morphology, immune cell development, and the epigenome of the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). Embryos were reared in four conditions: ambient or elevated temperature (14C or 18C) and two levels of microbial content (low richness (sterilized artificial sea water; SASW) or high richness (microbiome-exposed; MBE)). Larvae raised in SASW or at 18C were larger and had more pigment cells (antimicrobial immune cells) at 5 days post fertilization than MBE larvae. Development in MBE led to increased chromatin accessibility, predominantly in promoter regions, whereas 18C altered very few chromatin regions but was associated with more differentially expressed genes. Both developmental temperature and microbial content regulate larval metabolism, transcription/translation, and chromatin organization at the gene expression level, but often in opposing directions. Finally, larvae raised in MBE or 18C exhibited delayed immune system development. Overall, we showed that early developmental environments strongly influence whole-organism and molecular phenotypes, with early exposure to microbes altering the host immune system and epigenome.",

    "description": "Glacier-fed streams (GFSs) are harsh environments hosting unique, highly specialized communities. Interestingly, glaciers and their GFSs are also present in Earths tropical regions, where environmental characteristics contrast with GFS conditions elsewhere. Yet, despite the unique and isolated nature of tropical GFSs, little is known about their inhabitants, even though they may disappear later this century with ongoing climate change. Here, we examined diatom communities from one of the last tropical African GFSs in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda, to characterize the composition and diversity of this unique system. Six sediment-associated biofilm samples were collected from two reaches of a stream draining the Mt. Stanley Glacier, and the resident diatom communities were studied morphologically using light and scanning electron microscopy, as well as through the sequencing of amplicons from extracted DNA (18S and rbcL). In general, morphological results agree well with barcoding results, but each individually provides irreplaceable insights. In total, we identify 24 morphotypes utilizing light microscopy, 101 diatom Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) using 18S sequences, and 65 ASVs with rbcL. Across approaches, common genera include Achnanthidium, Psammothidium, Neidium, Cymbopleura, Eunotia, and Pinnularia. However, only about half of the diversity could be assigned to the species level across methodologies, including several of the most common taxa, indicating a high level of uniqueness. Accordingly, one of the most common taxa encountered is described here as a new species, Neidium rwenzoriense sp. nov. Our results emphasize the Rwenzori Mountains as a global hotspot for endemism, and the novelty of disappearing tropical GFSs as diatom habitats.",

    "description": "Acetate is a key intermediate in mineralizing organic matter, especially in deep subsurface environments with limited electron acceptors. Here, methanogenic archaea can split acetate to CH4 and CO2, while acetate-oxidizing bacteria can oxidize it to CO2 providing reducing equivalents for methanogens.In sediment enrichments from Bothnian Bay, we investigated how conductive particles affect marine acetate metabolism. Granular-activated-carbon (GAC) and magnetite were crucial for linking syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO) with CO2-reductive methanogenesis, known as CIET (Conductive Particle-mediated Interspecies Electron Transfer). Our previous observations showed a fourfold increase in methanogenesis with conductive particles compared to controls (no conductive particles). Labeled acetate was primarily taken up by a Geobacterales-like organism, converting the 13CH3-group to 13CO2. Inhibition experiments confirmed a metabolic co-dependency between Archaea and Bacteria, using Methyl-CoM inhibitors or antibiotics.Metagenomic analyses identified core CIET organisms exclusively present in incubations with conductive particles. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from these particles included the main players: a Geobacterales and a Methanosarcina, found only in such incubations.The Methanosarcina, typical of marine environments, harbors an Rnf-operon flanked by a membrane-bound methanogenesis multiheme cytochrome capable of bidirectional Extracellular Electrons Transfer (EET). The Geobacterales-MAG showcases over 40 multiheme c-type cytochromes, acetate transporters, and a complete acetate-oxidation pathway, confirming their potential for acetate-oxidation, and EET-capabilities.While these two organisms are key in acetate oxidation, other groups in the consortia may have secondary functions. Our findings highlight complex microbial interactions and diverse strategies in CIET, providing valuable insights into the metabolic capabilities of marine sediment consortia related to methane emissions.This study presents, for the first time, a well-characterized environmental DIET consortium using conductive particles, which appears to employ new electron exchange transfer methods. This consortium depends on conductive particles to maintain and process syntrophic acetate oxidation.",

However, our understanding of syntrophic bacteria in the proglacial lake sediments is largely unknown. By applying 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing on samples from non-ablation seasons, we analyzed the diversity, function, and activity of syntrophic propionate- and butyrate-oxidizing bacteria (SPOB and SBOB) in the sediments of a typical proglacial lake fed by Qiangyong glacier on the south Tibetan Plateau. We found a diverse array of putative canonical syntrophic bacteria, which exhibited an obvious spatial and temporal heterogeneity and played key roles in the species interaction network.",

Brine was filtered onto a 0.2 micron filter at cold temperature, and then flash frozen. The filters were extracted and sequenced using Nanopore. Metagenome assembled genomes were curated after assembly, and reads mapped back onto each MAG to obtain methylation information. We identified methylation motifs then conducted a comparative analysis of each motif's methylation levels across the ice horizons. In tandem with methylation related gene identification and functional annotations, this allows us to assign (or not) a regulatory role to DNA methylation.

    "description": "The methane-cycling microbiomes in Arctic permafrost-affected upland soils play crucial roles in the production and consumption of this important greenhouse gas. However, little is known about the distributions of Arctic methanogens and methanotrophs across the regional scale and along the vertical soil profile, as well as their responses to the widespread permafrost thaw. Using a unique sample set from nine different locations across the pan-Arctic, we identified methanogen and methanotroph phylotypes in 729 datasets of 16S rRNA gene amplicons.  In 621 samples of intact permafrost soils across the pan-Arctic, only 22 methanogen and 26 methanotroph phylotypes were identified. Abundances of both functional groups varied significantly between sites and soil horizons. Only four methanogen phylotypes were detected at all locations, with the hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium lacus dominating. Remarkably, the permafrost soil methane filter was almost exclusively comprised of a few phylotypes closely related to the obligate methanotrophic species Methylobacter tundripaludum.  In degraded permafrost sites in Alaska, M. tundripaludum also dominated the methanotroph microbiome in the wet site. However, in dry, water-drained former permafrost site, Methylocapsa phylotypes, closely related with the atmospheric methane oxidizing bacteria, were exclusively found and dominant, indicating a massive restructuring of the methanotroph guild that consequently resulted in functional changes from a soil methane filter to an atmospheric methane sink.   This study provides first insights into the identity and intricate spatial distribution of methanotrophs and methanogens in permafrost soils at a pan-Arctic scale and their responses to different water status after permafrost degradation. These findings point towards a few key microbes particularly relevant for future studies on Arctic CH4 dynamics in a warming climate and that under future dry conditions more atmospheric CH4 uptake in Arctic upland soils might happen.",

    "description": "The methane-cycling microbiomes in Arctic permafrost-affected upland soils play crucial roles in the production and consumption of this important greenhouse gas. However, little is known about the distributions of Arctic methanogens and methanotrophs across the regional scale and along the vertical soil profile, respectively. Using a unique sample set from eight different locations across the pan-Arctic we screened for methanogen and methanotroph phylotypes in 621 datasets of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Only 22 methanogen and 26 methanotroph phylotypes were identified in 621 upland soil samples. Relative abundances of both groups varied significantly between sites and soil horizons. Water content was not correlated with methanotroph abundance, but both were positively correlated with methanogen abundance. This suggested that water content might control methanogen abundance, which in turn drove methanotroph abundance by providing the substrate. Only four methanogen phylotypes were detected at all locations, with the hydrogenotrophic Methanobacterium lacus dominating. Remarkably, the methane filter was almost exclusively comprised of a few phylotypes closely related to the obligate methanotrophic bacterium Methylobacter tundripaludum SV96. This study provides first insights into the identity and intricate spatial distribution of methanotrophs and methanogens in permafrost soils at a pan-Arctic scale, and points towards a few key microbes particularly relevant for future studies due to permafrost thaw.",

    "description": "The trace element iron (Fe) is a major constraint for microbially-mediated processes in the Southern Ocean. The accelerated melting of glaciers could present a novel source of Fe, but whether glacial Fe is bioavailable to marine microbes is not known. We investigated the response of marine heterotrophic prokaryotes to Fe contained in colloids (20 nm – 200 nm) of glacial origin collected on Kerguelen Island (Southern Ocean). We followed prokaryotic growth in incubation experiments amended either with colloids of glacial or non-glacial origin and determined community composition and the abundance of genes involved in Fe-related processes in metagenomes and MAGs at the final time point. Glacial colloids stimulated the growth of prokaryotic taxa belonging to Pseudomonadaceae and Vibrionaceae, while Rhodobacteraceae, Flavobacteriaceae and Alteromonadaceae were the dominant contributors to the communities in the incubations amended with non-glacial colloids. Metagenomic analysis revealed a higher abundance of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the siderophores pyoverdine and vibrioferrin as well as their respective transporters in the presence of glacial colloids as compared to the non-glacial colloids. Genes for the transport of both siderophores were present in diverse MAGs, while biosynthesis genes were detected in fewer ones. MAGs belonging to Nitrincolaceae and Pseudomonadaceae had among the highest gene counts for the synthesis and transport of both siderophores. Our results suggest that the utilization of siderophores facilitates the access to Fe from glacial colloids and point to the key role of specific prokaryotes rendering this source of Fe available to Southern Ocean microbial communities.",

    "description": "The rapid decline of sea ice in the relatively understudied Central Arctic Ocean has a significant impact on bacterial biodiversity and the ecological functions they support. We investigated the bacterial community composition and their associated metabolic functions from three geographically distinct sea ice floes at the North Pole, western Amundsen, and western Nansen basin. We resolved the bacterial community diversity inhabiting the sea ice habitat with species-level precision using a long-read amplicon sequencing approach. The study revealed 10 unique bacterial phyla, comprising 114 genera and 62 species, mainly belonging to Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria, and Cyanobacteria, which were found to be prevalent across the three ice stations. We relate community diversity to different physicochemical properties of sea ice, including ice age and ice floe origin, through sea ice back-trajectory analysis. We inferred key microbially mediated metabolic functions associated with carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen cycling processes among the three sites through genome-resolved metagenomics. The data suggests the prevalence of sulfur cycling-associated processes (assimilatory &amp; dissimilatory sulfur metabolism) in the sea ice habitat. The heterotrophic bacterial groups were found to be dominant and significantly contribute to nutrient recycling and complex organic matter degradation during the summer sea ice melt season. Overall, our findings revealed that distinct differences were observed in bacterial community diversity and associated ecological functions correlating with sea ice type, origin and habitat characteristics in the Central Arctic Ocean.",

    "description": "In the search for more sustainable remediation strategies for PAH-contaminated soils, an integrated application of thermal remediation and bioremediation (TEB) may allow the use of less impacting temperatures by associating heating to biological degradation. However, the influence of heating on soil microbiota remains poorly understood, especially in soils from tropical regions. This work investigated the effects of low-temperature heating on creosote-contaminated soil bacteria. We used culture- dependent and 16S rRNA sequencing methods to compare the microbial community of soil samples heated to 60 and 100 oC for 1 h in microcosms. Heating to 60 °C reduced the density of cultivable heterotrophic bacteria compared to control soil (p < 0.05), and exposure to 100 °C inactivated the viable heterotrophic community. Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia (BCP) and Sphingobium were the predominant genera. Temperature and incubation time affected the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index (p < 0.05). At 60 °C and 30 days incubation, the relative abundance of Sphingobium decreased and BCP increased dominance. There heated network after 30 days showed less nodes and edges, however maintained its density and complexity. Both main genera are associated with PAH degradation, indicating a possible functional redundancy and is likely to maintain biodegradation ability at higher temperatures. We concluded that TEB may be a feasible strategy, allowing biodegradation in temperature ranges where thermal remediation does not completely remove contaminants.",

    "description": "Two genetic lineages of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, with relatively high (HR) and low (LR) resistance towards the bacterial pathogen Flavobacterium psychrophilum, respectively, were produced based on Chr25 QTL marker assisted selection. A controlled bath challenge with F. psychrophilum in a common garden set-up confirmed the differential resistance status of the fish strains. Analysis of surviving fish thirty days post-challenge showed that the expression of immune related genes in the intestinal wall of the fish differed significantly between high resistant HR and LR fish. A range of genes encoding cytokines (IL-1, Il-2, IL-4/13, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-22), innate immune effector molecules (SAA, cathelicidins, complement, hepcidin) and the immunoglobulin IgD gene were significantly upregulated in the HR fish, whereas corresponding genes (except of the SAA gene) remained unregulated in LR fish. We analyzed the gut content from fish in all groups in order to elucidate to what extent the gut microbiota could be influenced by host genes and pathogen exposure. The alpha diversity analysis, also for subgroups, supported our finding that the differences in alpha diversity could be only observed in the control group but not in the infected group. The differences between gut microbiotas in the two fish strains decreased after exposure. The study suggests a continuous cross-talk between host genetics, innate immune responses in the host intestinal wall and the microbial community of the fish gut.",

    "description": "Atmospheric ice nucleating particles (INPs) play a critical role in cloud formation, influencing both radiative and physical properties. Biogenic INPs are particularly effective in catalyzing ice formation, triggering heterogeneous freezing between -1 degrees Celsius and -15 degrees Celsius, which can impact mixed-phased clouds by enhancing precipitation and reducing albedo. Arctic waters are known to harbour highly active INPs, and the ongoing reduction of sea ice extent and the increasing exposure to open ocean may lead to elevated aerosolization rates of marine bioaerosols and INPs. In this study, we investigated INPs and microbial cells from ambient marine air and laboratory sea spray experiments, as well as from sea bulk water (SBW) and sea surface microlayer (SML) samples collected along a latitudinal transect from the Davis Strait to Baffin Bay, off the west coast of Greenland. We observed an increase in INP concentrations in SBW with increasing latitude, independent of terrestrial freshwater input. A positive correlation was found between INP concentrations in the SBW and the absolute abundance of specific bacterial and eukaryotic taxa, such as Lewinella and Dino-Group-I-Clade-5, suggesting these taxa may have ice-nucleation activity potential. We observed a clear distinction between the seawater microbiome and the above airborne microbiome. This indicates contributions from terrestrial sources through long-range transport to the collected ambient marine air samples. However, INP concentrations were elevated at higher latitudes in both air samples and sea spray experiments, correlating with INP levels in the SBW. INP concentrations in sea spray were significantly elevated compared to air samples, indicating that marine INP aerosolization is influenced by environmental factors, such as wind speed. Additionally, the taxa identified to correlate with INP concentrations in SBW showed no preference for aerosolization, suggesting a stochastic aerosolization process, as demonstrated in our sea spray experiments. This study enhances our understanding of the aerosolization process and underscores the contribution of Arctic marine-derived biogenic INPs to the atmosphere, highlighting the role of the Arctic Oceans as a major source of atmospheric biogenic INPs.",

We report that fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is safe, not related to severe adverse events, and attenuates HIV-associated dysbiosis. FMT elicits changes in gut microbiota structure, including significant increases in alpha diversity, and a mild and transient engraftment of donor’s microbiota during the treatment period.

    "description": "The study's objective was to search for microbial communities in the deepest layers of the Elbrus glacier, close to the bedrock. The study aimed to test the hypothesis that microbial assemblages deposited in high mountain environments could provide information about past local climate variations. The ice coring was carried out on the Western plateau of Mt Elbrus, 5115m above sea level) glacier in the Caucasus, Russia (2009). The deepest ice sample (closest to bedrock), 182 meters deep, was selected for the study. The core age could be estimated at 1670+/- 400 years. The temperature in situ (volcanic caldera) is expected to fluctuate around 0oC. This ice sample contained small-size mineral inclusions and underwent thorough decontamination and processing in clean rooms. Two sub-segments, 182up, and 182bottom, separated by 6.5cm, were treated individually. Genomic DNA was isolated from the concentrated meltwater and amplified using universal degenerate primers targeting the v3-v4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Initially, the amplicons were sequenced using a common Sanger sequencing approach, but no significant findings were obtained due to contamination and the limited number of clones investigated. Subsequently, the identical amplicons were sequenced using high-throughput Oxford nanopore technology. The sequencing revealed that most reads were contaminants, but around 1% passed all contamination criteria and belonged to the Proteobacteria (phylum Pseudomonadota).Interestingly, the two subsegments of ice contained unique non-overlapping taxa of Proteobacteria, suggesting that the ice in these segments may have been deposited under different local climatic conditions. Thus, the upper-most ice segment showed presence of Methylobacterium tardum, Sphingomonas gilva, Brevundimonas naejangsanensis, Comamonas aquatica, Luteimonas pelagia, and Halomonas (Vreelandella) azerica, while the bottom segment - Paracoccus gahaiensis, Delftia tsuruhatensis, Stenotrophomonas (Pseudomonas) geniculata, and the phylotype related to Acidibacter ferrireducens. Notably, Halomonas azerica, an indicator for cold period depositions (Bulat et al., 2024a, 2024b), was detected in the top 182up sample, indicating that the enclosed snow was deposited during a cold period. This finding suggests that deep terrestrial glaciers may contain diverse Eolian microbial assemblages, which could serve as proxies for local climate changes in the past.",

They give rise to species-rich microbial food webs in biological soil crusts. The terrestrial snow- and ice-free areas are in permanent expansion as glaciers retreat, leaving behind extensive areas of uncovered rock and new soil. Biological soil crusts stabilize the soil surface and have an important role in soil development. However, the microbial food webs and the nutrient and energy flow to higher trophic levels remain largely unexplored. Here, we characterized the microbial predator-prey dynamics of polar soils by combining molecular and traditional culturing techniques. Using high-throughput sequencing of environmental samples, we assessed the biodiversity and function of soil protists, applying a trait-based approach for acquiring and describing functional traits, i.e., feeding behavior of heterotrophic protists in relation to microalgae.",

    "description": "A prolonged stay at Antarctic research stations presents unique challenges because of the extreme environmental conditions, restricted diets, and cold temperatures, which can affect the gut microbiota, an aspect related to host health. However, the effects of the Antarctic environment on the gut microbiota remain uncertain because of the limited number of study participants and short study durations. In this study, we analyzed 467 fecal samples collected longitudinally from 48 participants who stayed at Antarctic stations for up to 16 months. Before departing to the Antarctic bases, male participants exhibited three distinct types of gut microbiota, which were differentially altered during and after the stay, depending on the pre-existing microbiota type. Prevotella-dominant microbiota was more susceptible to environmental changes, including the diet, compared with Bacteroides-dominant microbiota. Although the dominant genera in the gut microbiota were stable across all microbiota types, minor genera with high variability could mediate changes in the microbiota. Sharing diets and having frequent contact resulted in cohabitation effects among genetically unrelated participants in the extremely isolated Antarctic environment. The taxonomic composition was altered while staying at Antarctic bases based on the environment; however, the predicted functions of the gut microbiota were relatively stable over time. Overall, this study shows the impact of staying in remote Antarctic stations on the gut microbiota and indicates its alteration based on intrinsic microbiota prior to the mission.",

This study was done in the Arctic Ocean during leg 2 of MOSAiC, when RV Polarstern was drifting with an ice floe from 86.6 °N, 118.4°E on Dec 13, 2019 to 88.6°N, 61.3°E on Feb 23, 2020 in the eastern Amundsen Basin (Krumpen et al. 2020, Nicolaus et al. 2022). The sampling for the study was performed in the Central Observatory (CO) close to Polarstern, including the on ice oceanography site Ocean City and the MOSAiC sea ice coring site (MCS). A Sea Ice Ridge Observatory (SIRO) was established during leg 2 at a ridge in the CO named Fort Ridge. The ridge keel studied was approximately 100 m long and 20 m wide. DNA was extracted from water samples (250 – 500 mL) from 20 and 1000 m depth (10.02.2020), from a water- filled void inside the ridge (at 204-224 cm below the ice surface; 24.01.2020), a gypsum net tow (08.02.2020) and melted sea ice samples from FYI (ice interior; 03.02.2020), SYI (60-70 cm, 70-80 cm, 80-93 cm; 13.01.2020) and ridge ice above and below the water-filled void (157- 204 cm; 224 -  260 cm; 24.01.2020).

All samples were prefiltered through 100µm nylon mesh. For the large size fraction particles from the pre-filter were flushed onto 0.22µm Sterivex filters and filtrate was pumped for the small size fraction onto 0.22µm Sterivex filters using a Masterflex pump and silicone hoses.  Samples were stored in -80° until DNA extraction. Sequencing was performed using an Illumina MiSeq at the AWI, Bremerhaven, Germany.",

In the rapidly warming Arctic, increased glacier meltwater significantly impacts coastal microphytobenthic communities. Dominated by benthic diatoms, which are preferential hosts for fungal parasites, these communities represent a key component in the functioning of Arctic trophic food webs. In this project, we conducted amplicon sequencing of sediment samples from different locations around Kongsfjorden (Svalbard, Norway), collected along a salinity gradient between August and September 2022.",

    "title": "Linking Biogenic High-Temperature Ice Nucleating Particles in Arctic soils and Streams to Their Microbial Producers",
    "description": "Aerosols, including biological aerosols, exert a significant influence on cloud formation, influencing the global climate through their effects on radiative balance and precipitation. The Arctic region features persistent mixed-phase clouds, which are impacted by ice nucleating particles (INPs) that modulate the phase transitions within clouds, affecting their lifetime and impacting the region's climate. An increasing number of studies document that Arctic soils harbour a large number of biogenic INPs (bioINPs), but these have yet to be linked to their microbial producers. In addition, the transfer of bioINPs from soils into freshwater and marine systems has not been quantified. This study aimed at addressing these open questions by analyzing soil and freshwater samples from Northeast Greenland to determine the microbial composition along with the INP concentrations and size distributions. We found that soils contained between 3 x 104 and 6 x 106 INP g-1 soil, which was on the lower side of what has previously been reported for permafrost soils. The composition of INPs varied widely across locations and could have originated from bacterial and fungal sources. We found that Mortierella, a fungal genus known to produce ice-nucleating proteins, was present in nearly all samples. Spearman correlations between soil taxa and INP concentrations pointed at lichenized fungi as a possible contributor to soil INP. Additionally, based on the INP size distribution, we suggest that soil INPs were bound to soil particles or microbial membranes at some locations, while other locations showed a variety of soluble INPs with different molecular sizes. In streams, INP concentrations and onset temperatures were comparable to what has previously been measured in streams from temperate regions. Interestingly, stream INP concentrations showed a positive association with soil INP concentrations. The presence of highly active INPs in Arctic regions holds implications for mixed-phase cloud properties and climate, revealing the significant, yet complex, role that soil and stream bioINPs play in the Arctic ecosystem. This research contributes valuable knowledge to the understanding of microbial communities and the potential producers of highly active bioINPs in Arctic soil microbial communities and their connectivity with Arctic streams.",

While sulfur oxidation is thought to drive primary production in these environments and is considered a possible Mars relevant metabolism very few SOB have been successfully isolated from cold Arctic hypersaline environments. Metagenomic sequencing approaches have allowed for culture-independent profiling of these communities, but their metabolic and physiological traits remain largely uncharacterized due to fastidious growth requirements. Overcoming this barrier, multi-omics informed metabolic predictions coupled with traditional enrichment techniques have the potential to enable cultivation of previously uncharacterized polar SOB. This strategy can ultimately help to uncover the cold adapted bioenergetic capabilities of novel cryophilic SOB as well as traits that could allow analogous life in extraterrestrial environments.",

    "description": "Paraescarpia echinospica and Sclerolinum tubeworms were collected from the Haima Cold seep in the South China Sea. Paraescarpia echinospica was sampled in April 2023 at latitude and longitude (110.27E, 16.435N). Sclerolinum was sampled in July 2022 using the ROV robot. Paraescarpia echinospica was dissected with a sterile scalpel and scissors and sampled from the trophosome site. In contrast, Sclerolinum tubes were too thin and soft to be separated from the tissue, so the entire Sclerolinum was sampled directly. The samples were rinsed with DNA extraction buffer (100 mM Tris HCl, 100 mM EDTA, 100 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 M NaCl, 1% CTAB, pH 8.0) to eliminate any remaining surface impurities and preservatives. Subsequently, the tissue blocks were placed in 1 mL of DNA extraction buffer, which was adequately cut and left to stand with sterile scissors. The upper suspension containing microbial cells was collected after the large pieces of tissue were precipitated. The microorganisms were ultimately precipitated through high-speed centrifugation. The resulting microbial precipitates were obtained for macrogenetics studies. The DNA was extracted and purified using a magnetic bead-based soil and fecal genomic DNA extraction kit (TIANGEN) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Qualitative and quantitative analysis was performed on the purified DNA using a Qubit 4.0 device and agarose gel electrophoresis with 1% agarose. The VAHTS Universal Plus DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina was used for metagenomic library construction according to the manufacturer's protocol.Genome assembly was performed on the symbionts of Paraescarpia echinospica (Hai6C03) and Sclerolinum (SCTW1H) collected from Cold Seep, South China Sea. The Hai6C03 assembled genome had a size of 4,171,724 bp, a GC content of 54.43%, a completeness degree of 99.33%, and a contamination degree of 1.6%. The genome assembled by SCTW1H was 2,832,488 bp in size with a GC content of 50.46%. Its completeness was 94.72%, and the contamination degree was 0.23%.",

    "description": "The excellerated warming of the Arctic manifests in e.g., the thawing of permafrost, the loss of sea ice and the melting of glaciers. Glacial run-off increases the input of freshwater, sediments, and nutrients into fjords and coastal waters. The decrease in sea-ice cover and the loss of albedo results in firstly, increased radiation reaching through the water column and secondly, increased temperatures which both significantly alters the dynamics of the marine biota, e.g., leading to increased gross primary production. Previous studies indicate that marine areas are sources of biological material with ice nucleating properties and it has been suggested that these particles stem from algal exudates released during phytoplanktonic blooms. Rising temperatures may result in increased microbial activity, thereby influencing the concentration and characteristics of ice nucleating particles (INPs) in seawater. However, various microorganisms, which inhabit marine and terrestrial environments, are shown to produce ice nucleating active material. Thus, terrestrial environments can also be a source of INPs transported to the sea water by e.g. rivers and streams. Additionally, outwash of glacial sediment and permafrost soil contain highly active biological INPs that may be released in increasing numbers into the coastal ecosystem. The biological INPs can then be transferred from the marine areas into the atmosphere by wave breaking and bubble bursting and can subsequently be transported to higher altitudes where they may trigger the freezing of cloud droplets. Thereby, they would impact the lifetime of clouds as well as their radiative properties. Despite our knowledge of the presence of INPs in marine environments and possible impact on atmospheric processes, our understanding of both their characteristics and sources remains limited. To address these knowledge gaps, we sampled sea bulk water and sea surface microlayer between June and September 2018 in two southwest Greenlandic fjords and investigated the ice-nucleating particles along with the microbial community composition of both algae and bacteria present in these two marine compartments. Our study reveals a clear seasonal variation in the number and types of INPs. We found the highest concentration in June during the late stage of a phytoplanktonic bloom. Using filtration and heat treatments, we found that the highly active INPs found in June are smaller in size, and less heat sensitive compared to the INPs present in July and September, thus indicating different INP types and origin. A strong negative correlation between the number of INPs and salinity suggests inputs from either glacial melt water or sea ice melt as a potential source of INPs or a combination of both. However, stable oxygen isotope analysis pointed to meteoric water such as river runoff as the major source of the observed freshwater input indicating that the highly active INPs stem from a terrestrial source.",

Despite extensive research on Antarctic microbial ecology, a gap in knowledge persists regarding the comparative analysis of microbial communities associated with Antarctic granite and epilithic lichen environments. This study addresses the lack of research on both endolithic communities in granite and epilithic communities represented by lichens in Antarctica. Moreover, this study represents the first comparative analysis between these two ecologies, providing valuable insights into their microbial diversity and composition. We addressed this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of microbial communities colonizing granite surfaces in Antarctica, focusing on both endolithic and epilithic niches. Through high-throughput sequencing approaches, we characterized the fungal and bacterial diversity associated with these environments. Our results revealed distinct differences between endolithic and epilithic communities in terms of diversity and composition. Endolithic communities exhibited higher microbial diversity, likely influenced by a combination of environmental factors and the complex interplay between lichens and other microorganisms. Moreover, cyanobacteria were found to play a significant role in endolithic communities, demonstrating their adaptability to low-light conditions and their importance in nutrient cycling. Overall, our findings shed light on the ecological dynamics of microbial communities in extreme environments and highlight the importance of further research to elucidate their roles in Antarctic ecosystems.",

    "description": "Soil freeze-thaw is a common phenomenon at high latitude permafrost regions, and it can alter soil physical properties and microbial diversity. However, how the abundant and rare fungal groups respond to environmental temperature changes (i.e., seasonal variations), particularly freeze-thaw events, are still not well understood. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of soil properties, fungal community diversity, structure, and co-occurrence network in a typical seasonally frozen ecosystem, we sampled three times during the non-freeze-thaw period, freeze-thaw period, and freezing period, respectively. Our findings revealed that significant variations in the fungal community diversity were detected at different sampling stages. Notably, abundant and rare fungal taxa exhibited the differential response patterns. Compared to the non-freeze-thaw period, freeze-thaw cycling reduced the alpha diversity of the abundant fungal taxa, but increased the alpha diversity of rare fungal taxa. We also found that changes in community composition of rare taxa were more senstive to environmental temperature changes than abundant taxa, and they contributed more to the stability of co-occurrence network. Soil moisture content, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus were the primary factors affecting fungal community structure. Although soil pH had no significant impact on fungal community structure, it exhibited significant correlations with the rare taxa of p_Chytridiomycota and p_Mucoromycota. Overall, the study results provide useful information on the prediction of soil microorganisms in response to environmental temperature changes in seasonally permafrost regions under the background of global warming.",

We show that upland forested and grassland hillslopes with thermokarst features initiated in the last 50 to 70 years by thawing of ice-rich yedoma permafrost soils are an exceptionally large source of microbial 14C-depleted methane, especially in winter when surface soils freeze, limiting methanotrophy.",
    "description": "Microbial methane production associated with permafrost soils has been considered only in the seasonally thawed active layer and in inundated thermokarst lake and wetland sedimentsWalzEtAl2017,Turetsky2020NatGeo. Until now, dry, upland soils that dominate 87% of the ArcticHugeliusetal2014, are assumed to be an atmospheric methane sink that compensates for much of the northern wetland-derived feedbacks to climate warming this centuryOhEtAl2020. Contrary evidence about the role of uplands would require a paradigm shift leading to a new framework for understanding the permafrost carbon feedback. Here we used field-flux measurements, radiocarbon dating and borehole drilling to show that talik (thaw bulb) development in yedoma permafrost soils leads to large methane emissions in dry upland environments. Eddy covariance methane emissions from a graminoid-dominated hillslope with thermokarst-mounds were three times higher annually than wetland emissions from the same latitude. Seventy percent of upland emissions occurred in winter, when surface soils were frozen, shutting down the powerful capacity of methane oxidizing bacteria, but permitting escape of methane produced in underlying anoxic taliks. These findings require restructuring our framework of permafrost carbon feedback trajectories to climate change, and imply that methane emission from upland taliks has the potential to overwhelm methane consumption by surface soils.",

Our research combined 16S rRNA gene sequencing with 15N2 incubations. Results showed that N2 fixation rates were influenced more by climate and moss physiology than by microbial community shifts. Pleurozium schreberi increased N2 fixation in cooler conditions, while Aulacomnium turgidum's fixation rates were high regardless of location.

The dataset consists in amplicon sequencing data of 16S V4V5 and ITS2 of soil communities in a plant removal experiment based on mycorrhizal status at a sub-arctic forest-tundra ecotone. Each sample was analyzed prior to the experiment and after two years of manipulation. In addition, root endophytic fungi were targeted with ITS2 primers on 27 plant species found at the site, both with and without preliminary bleaching to remove rhizosphere-associated fungi. 16S paired-end reads are raw except for demultiplexing carried out through Illumina's software, ITS2 amplicon demultiplexing was done prior to upload according to SCATA processing of the original .ccs read file.

    "description": "Lichens are multi-kingdom symbioses in which fungi, algae and bacteria interact todevelop a stable selection unit. In addition to the mycobiont forming the symbiosis,fungal communities associated with lichens represent the lichen mycobiota. Theirdiversity is still largely unknown, we therefore aim to characterize it in two cosmopolitanlichens, i.e., Rhizoplaca melanophthalma and Tephromela atra. The mycobiota wereinvestigated across a broad range of their distribution using both a culture-dependentapproach and environmental DNA metabarcoding. The variation of the mycobiotaassociated with the two lichen species is extremely high, and a stable species-specificcore mycobiota is hardly identifiable. Most of the mycobiota taxa are present in a lowfraction of the samples, and no taxon is ubiquitously present in either lichen species.The mycobiota are thus composed of heterogeneous fungi, and some taxa aredetectable only by the culture-dependent approach. We suspect that lichens act asniches in which these fungi may exploit the thallus resources, while only a few mayestablish more stable trophic relationships with the major symbiotic partners.",

In this study the linkages between soil bacterial community structure and geochemical factors were investigated in a metallogenic sub-Arctic soil. Samples were obtained from gold and rare earth element (REE) enriched soils located in Mäkärä, Lapland, Northern Finland. Soil was sampled from the B horizon of nine sites around a gold-hematite quartz vein and one control site outside the mineralization. In addition, hematite samples were obtained from an excavated research trench.  Bacterial community structure in the soil and hematite samples was characterized by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing using Ion Torrent technology. Geochemical parameters of the soil samples were analyzed, and geochemical drivers of the bacterial community structure evaluated by multivariate methods. A particular interest was to identify linkages between gold and soil bacteria in an attempt to identify signature taxa associated with gold anomalies.",

    "description": "Thermophilic spore-forming anaerobes are present as dormant spores in cold marine sediments. Our work shows that in the Arctic, these thermospores are derived from warm marine subsurface ecosystems, such as hydrothermal fluid flow at mid-ocean ridges or deeply buried petroleum reservoirs, and then dispersed by ocean currents to marine sediments. Because these organisms are present in the Arctic as inactive spores that are buried in sediments over time, analysis of thermospore diversity along sediment depth cores provides a unique window into their evolutionary history and the ecological history of their deep biosphere sources. Therefore, our objective is to characterise the diversity and community composition of thermospores along two Arctic sediment depth cores, representing approximately 500 years, by using thermospore enrichment incubations followed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Changes in diversity with depth will be analysed by traditional OTU-based approaches combined with analysis of microdiversity within OTUs using Minimum Entropy Decomposition. We hypothesise that both OTU-level composition and fine-scale diversity within OTUs will vary with depth. Broader changes at the OTU-level will provide evidence of ecological or physical change within the subsurface habitats, while changes in microdiversity will reflect the evolutionary history of individual populations. This project is a novel step towards reconstructing both the evolutionary and ecological history of subsurface microbes.

    "description": "The sampling campaign took place during the Antarctic expedition November 2021- February 2022. In this campaign, 14 selected localities have been visited in the northern Victoria Land, within the south latitudinal range from the 72 to 77 parallel (Table 1). At least three individuals of each selected lichen species, when present and feasible to collect, were sampled in each locality. The samples were aseptically removed with the rock substrate using a geological hammer, placed into sterile plastic bags, and stored dry at -20 C, also during the transportation to the laboratories, until downstream analyses.The following lichen species were collected and used for the molecular analyses: the endemic Antarctic Acarospora flavocordia, Buellia frigida, Lecanora fuscobrunnea, Lecanora physciella, Lecidea cancriformis, and the cosmopolitan Pleopsidium chlorophanum, Rhizoplaca melanophthalma, Rusavskia elegans. Along the study they will be referred to by their abbreviated name as follow: A. flavocordia, B. frigida, L. fuscobrunnea, L. physciella, L. cancriformis, P. chlorophanum, R. melanophthalma and R. elegans.DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing of fungal and bacterial communitiesFor the amplicon sequencing analyses, three thalli of each species were selected from each location at which the lichen species was collected. Metagenomic DNA extraction was performed on a 0.5 cm2 fragment of the thallus, devoid of any symptoms of external infection or damage, which was removed from the substrate using a sterile razor blade, and transferred into 1.5 ml reaction tubes. The fragments underwent a series of washes: they were rinsed three times for 15 min with sterile water, followed by a 30 min cleaning step using a 2% Tween 80 solution. A final wash was performed for 15 min with sterile water. The DNA extraction from the cleaned fragments followed the CTAB protocol of Cubero et al. (1999), with minor adjustments. Potential contaminants during the DNA extraction process were checked by establishing negative control samples for each lichen species. These negative controls consisted of a 1.5 ml tube kept open during the whole extraction process, and processed in the same way as the lichen samples for the amplification and sequencing steps.To study the diversity of fungal communities, the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 region (ITS1) was targeted. The ITS1 region was amplified using the barcoded primers ITS1F (CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA) and ITS2 (GCTGCGTTCTTCATCGATGC; White et al., 1990; Smith and Peay, 2014). The PCR amplification protocol for the ITS1 fragments was run with the following condition: an initial denaturation at 94 C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 C for 45 sec, annealing at 55 C for 45 sec, extension at 72 C for 1 min, and a final extension step at 72 C for 5 min.The V4 variable region of the small ribosomal subunit 16S rDNA was used to assess bacterial diversity. This variable region was amplified using the primers F515 (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and R806 (GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) as described by Caporaso et al. (2012). The PCR amplification of the V4 variable region was performed with the following protocol: an initial denaturation at 94 C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 C for 45 sec, annealing at 50 C for 1 min, extension at 72 C for 90 sec, and a final extension step at 72 C for 10 mins.Samples were then sequenced in pair ends (2x300 bp) using the Illumina MiSeq platform at the Edmund Mach Foundation (San Michele all'Adige, Italy).",

    "description": "Microorganisms inhabit almost all available environments on Earth. They owe their successfulcolonizing skills partially to the ability of energy and nutrient providing substance storage. One suchsubstance are the macromolecular polymers called polyhydroxyacids (PHAs), that help survive periodiccarbon deficits but also enable to cope with several types of environmental stresses. Those polymers haverecently gained much attention as an environmentally friendly (biodegradable) alternative for oil-basedplastics.The main objective of this project is to examine the role of bacterial storage materials that arePHAs in adaptation of polar region bacteria to stress conditions but also to evaluate biotechnologicalpotential of those microbes and the PHAs they produce.Bacterial strains from the Arctic and Antarctic Psychrophile (cold-lovers) Collection (part of theCentral Collection of Strains of the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy ofSciences) will be screened for PHA production. This collection holds almost 3000 isolates derived fromvarious materials gathered during six expeditions to Arctic and Antarctica. Strains will be examined forPHA granule storage and presence of key PHA synthesis enzyme encoding genes. Genetic and genomicresearch will allow to determine the structure of the whole genetic apparatus encoding the PHA synthesisability in a given strain. Those gene clusters will be introduced into a model microorganism (Escherichiacoli) to further examine PHA influence on bacterial physiology. PHA-positive native and recombinantstrains as well as their PHA-negative mutant equivalents will be subjected to a range of cell damagingphysical and chemical conditions to determine PHA involvement in their survival. Insights into thechemical structure of the polar region bacteria-produced PHAs and its biosynthesis from waste productmaterials, like glycerol, will allow to evaluate their biotechnological potential.The reasons for tackling this specific subject are both scientific (ecologic) and economic. Polarregion bacteria experience a multiple of life-challenging factors in combinations not seen in otherenvironments. This causes an evolutionary emergence of mechanisms enabling growth in such harshcircumstances, like the ability to store and utilize PHAs. Therefore Arctic and Antarctic ecosystems mayhost a plenitude of diverse, stress resistant PHA producers, able to utilize new low temperaturebiosynthesis pathways using unusual carbon sources. The search and comprehensive analyses of suchstrains can prove extremely valuable when seeking to lower bioplastic production costs and raising theirpopularity among consumers.",

    "description": "Anaerobic digestion represents a key biotechnology for the transformation of organic waste into renewable energy (biogas), and relies on complex microbial communities that work in concert to degrade the complex substrates into methane and CO2. Here, we sequenced more than half a million high-quality, full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences from 285 full-scale anaerobic digesters (ADs) across the world to expand our knowledge about diversity and function of the bacteria and archaea in ADs. The sequences were processed into full-length 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variants (FL-ASVs), which were added to the MiDAS 4 database for bacteria and archaea in wastewater treatment systems to create MiDAS 5. The expansion of the MiDAS database significantly increased the coverage for bacteria and archaea in anaerobic digesters worldwide, leading to an improved rate of genus and species-level classification. Using MiDAS 5, we carried out an amplicon-based, global-scale microbial community profiling of the sampled ADs using three common sets of primers targeting different regions of the 16S rRNA gene in bacteria and/or archaea. We revealed how environmental conditions and biogeography shape the anaerobic digester microbiota. We also identify core and conditionally rare or abundant taxa, encompassing less than 1000 genera and species. These represent 83-99% and 10-64% of the accumulated read abundance, respectively, across samples depending on the amplicon primers used. Finally, we examined the global diversity of functional groups with known importance for the AD process. Our online global MiDAS Field Guide presents the data generated in this study and summarizes present knowledge about all taxa.",

    "description": "High-elevation arid regions harbor microbial communities reliant on metabolic niches and flexibility to survive. The oxidation of atmospheric trace gases, namely hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO), serves as a widespread tactic for organisms in these environments to drive aerobic respiration and, occasionally, carbon fixation under nutrient-limited conditions. In this study, we assessed whether proximity to Polloquere, a geothermal spring in an arid Andean salt flat, affects the metabolic structure and trace gas-oxidation potential of nearby soil microbial populations. Rates of atmospheric H2 and CO uptake were shown to increase with radial distance from the spring despite a drastic decline in biomass. Kinetic estimates suggest that gas emission from Polloquere enriches the local environment with trace gases, resulting in decreased substrate affinity for H2 and CO compared to similar environments. Metagenomic analyses revealed a shift in the metabolic landscape from the spring-adjacent to distal soils, with trace gas-oxidizers becoming increasingly prevalent and phylogenetically diverse as the soils leave the influence of the hot spring. These results indicate that Polloquere represents a \"microbial oasis\" within the salar, hosting divergent communities across a restricted spatial scale and potentially acting as a model ecosystem for other geothermal systems in desert environments.",

    "description": "Fresh-frozen stool banks intended for human patients with gastrointestinal and metabolic disorders have been recently established and there is an ongoing effort to establish the first veterinary fresh-frozen stool bank. Fresh frozen stored feces provide an advantage of increased availability and accessibility to high-quality optimal donor fecal material. The stability of frozen canine feces regarding fecal microbiome composition and diversity has not been reported in dogs, providing the basis for this study. We hypothesized that fecal microbial composition and diversity of healthy dogs would remain stable when stored at -20 deg C and -80 deg for up to 12 months compared to baseline samples evaluated before freezing. Stool samples were collected from 20 apparently healthy dogs, manually homogenized, cryopreserved in 20% glycerol and aliquoted, snapped frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20 deg C or -80 deg C for 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Baseline samples and thawed aliquots were treated with propidium monoazide before fecal DNA extraction and following long-read 16S-rRNA amplicon sequencing, the community composition and diversity were compared across treatment groups. We demonstrated that 20% glycerol cryopreserved fresh-frozen canine stools collected from 20 apparently healthy dogs could be stored for up to 12 months at -80 deg C with minimal change in microbial community composition and diversity and that storage at -80 deg C is superior to storage at -20 deg C. We also found that differences between dogs had the largest effect on community composition and diversity. Certain bacterial taxa, such as short-chain fatty acid fermenters, had positive and negative survival correlations with specific storage conditions and duration. It remains to be determined if fecal donor material that differs in bacterial community composition and diversity across storage conditions and duration could lead to differences in clinical efficacy for specific clinical indications of fecal microbiota transplantation.",

    "description": "The French/talian Concordia Research Station, situated on the Antarctic Polar Plateau at an elevation of 3,233 meters above sea level, offers a unique opportunity to study the presence and variation of microbes introduced by abiotic or biotic vectors and consequently appraise the amplitude of human impact in such a pristine environment. This research builds upon a previous work, which explored microbial diversity in the surface snow surrounding the Concordia Research Station. While that study successfully characterized the bacterial assemblage, detecting fungal diversity was hampered by the low DNA content. To address this knowledge gap, in the present study, we optimized the sampling by increasing ice/snow collected to leverage the final DNA yield; this allowed us to target specific microbial groups, such as fungi, through amplicon sequencing. Our findings provide the first comprehensive overview of both fungal and bacterial diversity in the Antarctic Polar Plateau's surface snow/ice near Concordia Station and to identify seasonality as the main driver of microbial diversity; we also detected the most sensitive microorganisms to these factors, which could serve as indicators of human impact in this pristine environment and aid in planetary protection for future exploration missions.",

    "description": "This dataset is part of a study submitted to FEMS Microbiology Ecology under the title \"Recently-formed Antarctic lakes host less diverse benthic bacterial and diatom communities than their older counterparts\". The fastq files contain V4 16S rDNA sequences (primer pair 515F/806R) which were demultiplexed, barcode tags and primer sequences removed, and paired-end reads joined (using the QIIME2 plugin cutadapt v. 2021.11). At such stage, the sequences are prior to the filtering and thus contain not only Bacterial reads but also Archeal, mitochondrial, plastidial, chimeric and low-quality sequences which, in the submitted study, were filtered out during the subsequent steps of the pipeline. In case of interest in more details and/or data, see the publication or contact the authors (jan.kollar.phd@gmail.com). The abstract of the submitted manuscript follows:\"Glacier recession is leaving behind new waterbodies in proglacial forelands worldwide, including Antarctica. Yet, it is not known how microbial communities of recently formed young waterbodies (originating decades to a century ago) compare with established old counterparts (millennia ago). Here, we compared benthic microbial communities of young and old lakes on James Ross Island, Antarctic Peninsula, using 16S rDNA metabarcoding and light microscopy to explore bacterial and diatom communities, respectively. We found that microbial communities significantly differed among the two age groups, with older lakes hosting significantly more bacterial and diatom diversity than young ones. To identify potential mechanisms for these differences, linear models and dbRDA analyses found combinations of water temperature, pH, and conductivity to be the most important factors for microbial diversity and community structuring. These results, along with the application of an indicator species analysis, hint at the importance of thermal, ionic, and physical habitat constraints to community assembly, and that newly formed waterbodies are not likely to share the same level of diversity as established ones. Collectively, these results improve our understanding of microbial community drivers in Antarctic freshwaters, and help predict how the microbial landscape may shift with future habitat creation within a changing environment.\"",

    "description": "Warming temperatures are enhancing permafrost degradation, allowing the vast stores of organic matter to undergo decomposition by microbes (biodegradation). Due to differences in the composition of the substrate and structure of the active microbes, not all dissolved organic matter in permafrost is susceptible to biodegradation. Hence, it is unclear how changing dissolved organic matter and microbial community structure might affect the biodegradation rates. To address this question, we completed a 28-day incubation experiment using leachates from active layer, Holocene-origin permafrost, and Pleistocene-origin permafrost from a series of retrogressive thaw slump sites on the Peel Plateau, NT, Canada. We assessed dissolved organic matter composition and microbial community composition at the start and end of the experiment, while also tracking oxygen concentrations throughout to determine biodegradation rates. Our results emphasize the need to account for variation in dissolved organic matter composition and biolability across stratigraphic, landscape, and regional scales, and to better constrain how these factors together may further impact the fate of carbon following permafrost thaw.",

These structures, typically composed of steel or wood, are substrates for microbial attachment and biofilm formation. Success of biofilm growth depends on substrate characteristics and local environmental conditions, though it is unclear which feature is dominant in shaping biofilm microbiomes. The goal of this study was to understand substrate- and site-specific impacts of built structures on short-term biofilm composition and functional potential. This study demonstrates how substrate composition shapes biofilm microbiomes and suggests marine biofilms may contribute to nutrient cycling at depth. Analyzing the marine biofilm microbiome is a first step to understanding the ecological consequences of ocean sprawl.",

Initially, 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis was used to identify environments with high bioprospecting potential in a Svalbard glacier system. Thereafter, shotgun metagenomics was used to understand the high-potential environments better.",

    "description": "Arctic climate change is leading to sea-ice attrition in the Last Ice Area along the northern coast of Canada and Greenland, but less attention has been given to the associated land-based ecosystems. Here we evaluated bacterial community structure in a hydrologically coupled cryo-ecosystem in the region: Thores Glacier, proglacial Thores Lake, and its outlet to the sea. Deep amplicon sequencing revealed that Polaromonas was ubiquitous, but differed genetically among diverse niches. Surface glacier-ice was dominated by Cyanobacteria, while the perennially ice-capped, well-mixed water column of Thores Lake had a unique assemblage of Chloroflexi, Actinobacteriota, and Planctomycetota. Species richness increased downstream, but glacier microbes were little detected in the lake, suggesting strong taxonomic sorting. Ongoing climate change and the retreat of Thores Glacier would lead to complete drainage and loss of the lake microbial ecosystem, indicating the extreme vulnerability of diverse cryohabitats and unique microbiomes in the Last Ice coastal margin.",

    "title": "methane cycling in an Arctic lake in Kangerlussuaq Greenland",
    "description": "Lakes are currently responsible for a significant amount of total natural methane emission. Microbial oxidation of methane plays a central role in Arctic carbon cycling, potentially reducing methane emissions from lakes, though little is known about methane cycling in the water column of Arctic lakes. Using stable isotope and 16S rRNA gene sequencing we determined carbon and hydrogen isotopes and microbial community composition down the water column of Teardrop lake, under open-water conditions. We found that isotopic values of methane in Teardrop lake were again highly enriched at 4 m depth for carbon and hydrogen isotopes, respectively. Surprisingly, methane concentrations slightly increased at the interval with isotope enrichment, not typical of classic methanotrophy. Consistent with isotopic enrichment we detected the highest relative abundance of putative methanotrophs, in particular Methylovulum at 4 m. The highest relative abundance of putative methanogens was detected at 3 m as well as at 5 m. At the same depth interval, temperature and oxidation reduction potential also increase, supporting increased microbial activity mid-depth. Based on geochemical and microbial observations, we suggest that the methane cycling in Teardrop lake is decoupled from a traditional depth dependent model where the dominant source of methane is in the anoxic sediments. Instead, methane in the water column is likely from a combination of anoxic sediment, littoral transport and oxic methanogenesis in the mid-water column, and recycling of carbon within the water column is leading to extreme isotope enrichments. Thus, understanding linkages between depth-dependent microbial dynamics and methane biogeochemistry are necessary to constrain the sensitivity of the methane cycle to future climate change",

    "description": "The specific environmental conditions of the ocean, especially its high hydrostatic pressure, wide-ranging temperatures, and oligotrophic conditions have affected marine bacteria in various ways, forcing them to adapt to widely different conditions. Importantly, little is known about the genetic mechanisms for environmental adaptation. We hypothesize that one of the environmental factors which play a significant role in bacterial growth and development is temperature. Further, we hypothesize that in adapting to the different environments, bacteria change their metabolomic profiles and antagonistic activity. In our laboratory, it was shown that some marine streptomycetes produce such antibiotics as actinomycin and landomycin in a temperature-dependent manner, but we still do not know the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon. Thus, the aim of this project is to describe the temperature dependence of selected arctic bacteria and elucidate the molecular mechanism of the temperature adaptation. We hypothesize that a novel regulatory mechanism underlies this which can be exploited to access other cryptic natural products.",

    "title": "Bacterial communities of Antarctic lichens explored by gDNA and cDNA 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing",
    "description": "Recently, lichens came once more into the scientific spotlight due to their unique relations with Prokaryotes. Several temperate region lichen species have been thoroughly explored in this regard using state-of-the-art meta-omic technologies. However, the information on Antarctic lichens and their associated bacteriobiomes is somewhat lacking, despite the regions large phylogenetic and ecophysiological diversity of lichen species. In this paper we assessed the phylogenetic structure of the whole and active fractions of bacterial communities housed by Antarctic lichens growing in different environmental conditions by targeted 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing based on gDNA, as well as cDNA. Bacterial communities associated with lichens procured from a nitrogen enriched site (Penguin rookery) were very distinct from the communities isolated from lichens of a nitrogen depleted site (inland plateau). The former were characterized by substantial contributions of Bacteroidetes phylum members and the elusive Armatimonadetes. At the nutrient-poor site the lichen-associated bacteriobiome structure was unique for each lichen species, with chlorolichens being occupied largely by Proteobacteria. Lichen species with a pronounced discrepancy in diversity between the whole and active fractions of their bacterial communities were those regarded as having a wide ecological amplitude, hinting that the non-active part of the community is a reservoir of stress coping mechanisms activated during environmental condition changes. This is the first investigation to make use of transcriptomics to infer the bacterial biodiversity in Antarctic lichens, thus highlighting the role of prokaryotic symbionts in the adaptability and consequently the evolution of lichens in this harsh and intriguing ecosystem",

    "title": "Western Antarctic Peninsula plankton raw sequence reads",
    "description": "The Southern Ocean in the vicinity of Antarctica is a region characterized by seasonally-driven marine phytoplankton blooms that are often dominated by microalgal species which produce large amounts of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) - which has multiple physiological and ecological roles. After its release from phytoplankton, DMSP is consumed by marine bacteria to access the sulfur and carbon for biomass production, or is broken apart by algal and/or bacterial enzymes, releasing dimethylsulfide (DMS). It is thought that the presence of DMSP can influence the diversity of microbial assemblages in seawater due to the tight coupling of many processes involving DMSP that are mediated by marine planktonic bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes. Just as the DMSP cycle may influence the structure and composition of microbial assemblages, it is probable that the types of microorganisms present in a parcel of seawater at a given time or location will affect the magnitude (and direction) of DMSP cycling. This two-way interaction may depend on several factors, including the genomic potential of the microbes in the community, the frequency of DMSP genes within the microbial assemblage, as well as the broader functional and biological diversity of the microorganisms in a particular environment. Given the almost universal presence of DMSP in seawater, understanding its cycling can help us quantify and reproduce bacterial-protistan interactions in various oceanic regions. The major goals of the project are to examine: (1) the extent to which the cycling of DMSP in Southern Ocean waters influences the composition and diversity of bacterial and protistan assemblages; (2) conversely, whether the composition and diversity of Southern Ocean protistan and bacterial assemblages influence the magnitude and rates of DMSP cycling; (3) the expression of DMSP degradation genes by marine bacteria seasonally and in response to additions of DMSP; and, to synthesize these results by quantifying (4) the microbial networks resulting from the presence of DMSP-producers and DMSP-consumers along with their predators in SO waters. We will conduct continuous growth experiments with DMSP-amended natural samples during field sampling of different microbial communities present in summer and fall seasons. Data from the molecular (such as 16S/18S tag sequences, DMSP-cycle gene transcripts) and biogeochemical (such as biogenic sulfur cycling, bacterial production, microbial biomass) investigations will be integrated via network analysis.",

    "description": "Climate warming can affect freeze thaw cycles (FTCs) patterns in northern high-latitude regions and might affect permafrost carbon emissions. The response of carbon release and microbial communities to FTCs has not been well characterized. Here, we conducted laboratory incubation experiments to investigate the relationships among carbon emissions, bacterial community, and soil variables in a permafrost-affected forest wetland ecotone in Northeast China. The emission rates of CO2 and CH4 increased during the FTCs. FTC amplitude, FTC frequency, and patch type had significant effects on carbon emissions. FTCs increased the contents of soil DOC, NH4+-N, and NO3--N but reduced bacterial alpha diversity (Chao and Shannon indices). CO2 emissions were mainly affected by bacterial alpha diversity and composition, and the inorganic nitrogen content was the most important factor affecting CH4 emissions. Our findings indicated that FTCs could significantly regulate CO2 and CH4 emissions by reducing bacterial community diversity and increasing the concentration of available soil substrates, and increases in CO2 emissions and decreases in CH4 emissions were related to declines in bacterial alpha diversity. Our findings shed new light on the microorganism-substrate mechanisms regulating the response patterns of soil carbon cycle to FTCs in permafrost regions.",

    "description": "The Arctic is a hot spot for climate change with potentially large consequences on a global scale. Aerosols, including bioaerosols, are important players in regulating the heat balance through direct interaction with sunlight and indirectly, through cloud formation. Airborne bacteria are key bioaerosols as some species produce the most potent ice nucleating proteins which are implicated in the formation of ice in clouds. Little is known about the numbers and dynamics of airborne bacteria in the Arctic and even less on a seasonal basis. We collected samples of aerosol and wet deposition in spring 2015 and summer 2016, at the Villum Research Station in Northeast Greenland. We used amplicon sequencing and qPCR targeting the 16S rRNA genes to assess the quantities and composition of the total and active bacterial community. We found a clear seasonal variation in the atmospheric bacterial community, which is likely due to variable sources and meteorology. In early spring, the atmospheric bacterial community was dominated by taxa originating from temperate and Sub-Arctic regions and arriving at the sampling site through long-range transport of air masses. In late spring, the long-range transport ceased, and the local sources were weak resulting in low bacterial concentrations. In summer, the air bacterial community was confined to local sources such as soil, plant material and melting sea-ice. In spring, we found that aerosolized and deposited Cyanobacteria had a high activity potential, implying their activity in the atmosphere or in surface snow. We observed a very efficient washout of the aerosolized bacterial cells during a snowstorm, which was followed by very low concentrations of bacteria in the atmosphere during the consecutive 4 weeks. We suggest that this is because long-range air mass transport is less prominent, leaving aerosolization from ice and snow as the only available sources for a new airborne bacterial community to re-establish. This is supported by observed changes in the chemical composition of aerosols. Overall, we show how biological aerosol composition in the high Arctic varies on a seasonal scale, identify their potential sources, demonstrate how their community sizes varies in time, investigate their diversity and determine their activity potential.",

    "description": "Previous research into post-operative antibiotic usage for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients generated contradictory results. Some studies found that post-operative antibiotics did not improve the short-term clinical outcomes, while some did. Those studies had also focused primarily on the clinical outcomes of the surgery, overlooking the potential impact of prophylactic antibiotics on the sinonasal microbiome. Using cultivation-independent methods, this study aimed to examine the impact of post-operative antibiotics on the sinonasal microbiome alongside short-term clinical outcomes of CRS patients undergoing endoscopic sinus survey (ESS). Twelve patients undergoing ESS to treat their CRS were enrolled in this study and randomly distributed into two groups: an antibiotic treatment group and a placebo treatment group. The antibiotic treatment group received doxycycline for 28 days after surgery. Clinical information, including computed tomography scans, symptom questionnaires, and nasal endoscopy, were collected for each patient before and after ESS. Swab and tissue samples were collected and underwent DNA extraction, PCR amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, and amplicon sequencing analysis to longitudinally characterise each patient’s sinonasal microbiome. There were no differences in symptom scores or endoscopic/radiological scores between treatment groups before or after the surgery, and there was no significant difference in the microbiome between the treatment groups after surgery. Our preliminary study showed that post-operative antibiotics did not improve short-term clinical outcomes for CRS patients undergoing ESS, and there was no significant difference in the microbiome between treatments, either. However, our preliminary findings reflect only short-term effects, and many of our analyses were statistically underpowered due to the modest sample size. A larger study is needed to explore specific patterns observed in our data with greater confidence.",

    "description": "Climate change is gradual, but it can also cause brief extreme heat waves that can exceed the upper thermal limit of any one organism. To study the evolutionary potential of upper thermal tolerance, we evolved the cold-adapted Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis to survive at high temperatures. This bacterium grows best at 15°C, but laboratory evolution helped it to survive at 30°C, beyond its ancestral thermal limit. This high-temperature adaptation occurred rapidly and in multiple populations. It involved genomic changes that occurred in a highly parallel fashion and mitigated the effects of protein misfolding. However, it also confronted a hard physiological limit, because populations failed to grow beyond 30°C. This limit might be overcome when an environment changes more slowly than the time scale of experimental evolution, but not when change is rapid. Our experiments aimed to facilitate evolutionary rescue by using a small organism with large populations living at temperatures several degrees below their upper thermal limit. Larger organisms with smaller populations and living at temperatures closer to their upper thermal tolerances are even more likely to go extinct during extreme heat waves.",

    "description": "Here, we aimed to evaluate the influence of the plant-host identity and habitat conditions on structuring the plant fungal endophytic community; but moreover, to estimate their local adaptive role assessing their effect on the fitness of both native plant hosts. For this, we combined a descriptive metagenomic analysis with a reciprocal transplant experiment using plants with and without its fungal endophytes to: i) characterize the variation in fungal communities among plant species (Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica), plant tissues (roots and leaves), and habitats (hill and coast) of the Maritime Antarctica, and ii) to determine the role of those endophytic microorganisms in plant capacity to cope with the different ecological settings in Antarctica. Overall, from the 108 fungal taxa found among both plant hosts, 68 for C. quitensis and 81 for D. antarctica, a 5 and 13% of unique genera were found for the former in hill and coast habitats, respectively, while for D. antarctica this proportion represented a 13 and 16%. The Bray-Curtis and the ordination analyses showed, however, a significant role of both, plant species and local habitat, in structuring the host fungal endophytic community, being the later particularly evident in D. antarctica. Finally, a higher average mortality and the reduced mean final biomass showed by cross-transplanted plants (e.g.: from coast-to-hill), relative to auto transplanted individuals (e.g.: from hill-to-hill) in D. antarctica, suggesting a microbe-mediated process of local adaptation for this species. These results may imply that both native plants are following different ecological strategies (generalist or specialist) regarding their interaction with fungal endophytes, an aspect that might be determinant in explaining their current and future patterns of distribution among Antarctic ecosystems.",

    "description": "Invasive plants may cause a negative impact to native species due to competition for resources. This is the case of Poa annua, the only non-native plant species successfully established in Maritime Antarctica. Therefore, it is important to understand which factors could be driving the competitive success of P. annua, even despite the harsh environmental conditions. One of such factors is the establishment of novel mutualistic relationships with the resident soil fungi, which would improve plant growth and confer protection against stressful conditions. Additionally, plant-associated (endophytic) fungi could also participate in seedling development and establishment, by being vectored in seeds. Therefore, in this study we explored the composition and compared the diversity of fungal communities in different P. annua tissues (seeds, leaves and roots) with representative samples of Antarctic tundra soil by using ITS2 sequencing. Our results suggest that P. annua would have a strikingly different microorganism community compared with Antarctic soil, as only 6 amplicon sequence variants were shared among plants and soils; therefore, it is plausible that the invasive success of P. annua is mediated by its' unique endophytes (rather than soil fungi).",

    "title": "Winter time simulations induce changes in the structure, diversity and function of Antarctic sea ice-associated microbial communities.",
    "description": "Antarctic sea ice is exposed to a wide range of environmental conditions during its annual existence, however, there is very little information describing the change in sea iceassociated microbial communities SIMCO during the changing seasons. It is well known that, during the solar seasons, SIMCO plays an important role in the polar carbon cycle, by increasing the total photosynthetic primary production of the South Ocean and participating in the remineralization of phosphates and nitrogen. What remains poorly understood is the dynamic of SIMCO populations and their ecological contribution to carbon and nutrient cycling throughout the entire annual life of Antarctic sea ice, especially in winter. Sea ice at this time of the year is an extreme environment, characterized by complete darkness which stops photosynthesis, extremely low temperatures in its upper horizons down to 45C, and high salinity up to 150_250 PSU in its brine inclusions, where SIMCO thrive. Without a permanent station, wintering expeditions in Antarctica are technically difficult; therefore, in this study, the process of autumn freezing was modeled under laboratory conditions, and the resulting young ice was further incubated in cold and darkness for one month. The ice formation experiment was primarily designed to reproduce two critical conditions: i total darkness causing the photosynthesis to cease, and ii the presence of a large amount of algae-derived organic matter. As expected, in the absence of photosynthesis, the activity of aerobic heterotrophs quickly created microoxic conditions, which caused the emergence of new players, namely facultative anaerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Following this finding, we can state that the Antarctic pack ice and its surrounding ambient under_ice seawater and platelet ice are likely to be very dynamic and can quickly respond to environmental changes, caused by the seasonal fluctuations. Given the size of the Antarctic pack ice, even in complete darkness and cessation of photosynthesis, its ecosystem appears to remain active, continuing to participate in the global carbon and sulfur cycling under harsh conditions.",

    "description": "Chemolithoautotrophic production of nitrate is accomplished by the polyphyletic functional group of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). A widely distributed and important NOB type in cold nitrogen removal systems is Nitrotoga, which however remains understudied due to the scarcity of cultivated representatives. Here, we present genomic features of five Nitrotoga strains from various habitats, including the first obligate marine species enriched from an aquaculture system. Comparative analysis of the Nitrotoga genomes showed, e.g., a unique gene repertoire of the marine strain that could be advantageous in its natural habitat and confirmed the lack of genes for assimilatory nitrite reduction in a strain found to require ammonium for growth. Overall, these data largely broaden our knowledge of Nitrotoga and elucidates the ecological role of this group of nitrite oxidizers.",

    "description": "Soils harbor an immense diversity of microorganisms — the most biodiverse habitat on Earth — which govern the fate of our planet’s largest store of organic carbon (SOC). At present, our ability to predict the impact of climate change and disturbance on the persistence of SOC is limited by the lack of data capturing informative differences among soils at relevant scales. The processes of SOC formation and loss are governed by complex adaptive systems which are top-down, such as climate, land-use, geology, and bottom-up, including the physicochemical and biological properties of soil.  Despite the complexity and heterogeneity of soils, we find stable associations within and between soil types. We hypothesize that soil taxonomy serves as an appropriate categorical scale where the top-down and bottom-up processes driving soil formation and C-cycling can be defined. We are leading an effort to build a large library that integrates modern assays of chemical and biological diversity in ways that assist terrestrial ecosystem models. In this project, we characterized the chemical (metabolome) and microbial (16S and ITS amplicon libraries) signatures of 50 paired surface (0-10 cm) and subsurface (~1 m below the surface) soils from diverse biomes and soil orders.",

    "description": "Although cryoconite holes, sediment-filled melt holes on glacier surfaces, may appear small and homogenous, they are large relative to their microbial inhabitants and offer opportunities for spatial partitioning of their environment. Vertical partitioning by microbial communities at the water-sediment interface is a common characteristic of all bodies of water, including freezing lakes. Yet the relatively large size and inherent ecological variability among lakes makes the study of vertical partitioning challenging. But the small size and spatial concentration of cryoconite holes provide a compelling model system in which to study microbial communities in relatively simplified aquatic ecosystems. To determine the degree to which vertical partitioning occurs in cryoconite holes, we compared microbial communities from sediment and water columns of frozen cryoconite holes in Taylor Valley, Antarctica. Specifically, 30 frozen cryoconite holes were sampled on each of three glaciers along a gradient of biomass and richness in the valley: Taylor, Canada, and Commonwealth Glaciers. DNA was extracted separately from the bottom sediment (cryoconite) and frozen overlaying water column (ice) of each sample. Both bacterial and eukaryotic OTU richness was substantially higher in the sediment than the water column. Although we expected water column microbial communities to be dilute versions of those found in the sediments, only the most abundant sediment species were detected in the water column. Furthermore, water column communities contained unique sequences, which were primarily from organisms that do not live in cryoconite holes or the Dry Valleys (e.g. fish), and which likely represent DNA from atmospheric deposition in the low biomass water columns. Additional indices of microbial abundance and biomass, specifically dissolved organic matter, chlorophyll a, and total DNA, were at least an order of magnitude higher within the sediments than the water columns. These observations from frozen cryoconite holes, combined with previous observations of melted holes, suggest that there may be a seasonal component to vertical partitioning that could be driven by both biological (e.g. seasonal migration) or physical (e.g. gravitational settling or freeze concentration). Confirming the vertical partitioning of microbial communities within cryoconite holes provides an opportunity to further investigate aspects of niche partitioning, such as impacts to biogeochemical cycling, within an easily replicable system.",

    "description": "Complex microorganisms of different types of low-temperature Daqu (LTD) play an important roles in the formation of flavors and qualities of light-flavor Baijiu (LFB) during fermentation. However, understanding the similarities and differences of taxonomic and functional diversity of the whole microorganisms among the three types of LTD still remains a major challenge. Here, metagenomic sequencing combined with culture-based methods and physicochemical indicators determination were used to study the three types of LTD used in the brewing of LFB. Our results revealed that the diversity of microorganisms in LTD was very high, and 1286 genera and 4157 species could be detected in all samples. Bacteria and fungi together constitute the main microbial in LTD, and the relative abundance ratio of bacteria to fungi in LTD was above 4:1. Houhuo and Hongxin have the highest relative abundance of bacteria and fungi in the three kinds of LTD, respectively. Bacillus (21.18%) and Bacillus licheniformis (17.45%) were the most abundant microorganisms in LTD at the level of genus and species, respectively. The different production temperatures of LTD have little effect on the microbial composition, but would lead to significant changes in the relative abundance of microorganisms in LTD. Among the three types of LTD, HH has the highest abundance of bacteria, fungi and lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The representative dominant species among each type of LTD showed high consistency in microbial functions. The microbes with higher relative abundance in Qingcha and Hongxin not only could produce specific flavor substances, but also had strong ability to degrade macromolecular substances in raw materials, and the representative dominant microorganisms in HH are more involved in metabolic pathways related to the production of flavor substances in liquor, which are highly complementary to the microbial functions of Qingcha. This study will significantly improve our understanding the effect of temperature on LTD quality and help guide the future exploration of microbial resources for the improvement of LTD products.",

    "description": "In the aquaculture sector, there is an increased interest in developing environmentally friendly alternatives to antibiotics in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections. In this study, we focused on the freshwater pathogen Flavobacterium psychrophilum and investigated the effects of antibiotics (florfenicol) and phage therapies on the gut microbiota of healthy and infected rainbow trout fry (1-2 g). Florfenicol-coated feed was administered for 10 days starting two days after the infection procedure. A two component mix of phage targeting F. psychrophilum (FpV4 and FPSV-D22) was continuously delivered by feed with a prophylactic period of 12 days. Samples of the distal intestine were collected over time (day -1 and 1, 8 and 33 days post infection) and analyzed by community analysis targeting the 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 region).",

    "description": "Here we investigated differences in benthic bacterial community structure from surface sediments at the Laptev Sea continental slope between two contrasting years, 1993 and 2012. Samples were retrieved on two Polarstern expeditions sampling the same stations between 60 and 3400 m water depth: Polarstern expedition PS27 (ARK-IX/4) in 1993 and Polarstern expedition PS80 (ARK-XXVII/3) in 2012. Sampling was conducted with a multiple corer (MUC), in order to retrieve undisturbed sediment cores. Upon retrieval of the MUC, the overlying water was carefully removed from each core and the upper first centimeter of sediment was cut using a steel plate and a custom-made plastic ring. DNA was extracted from 1 g of sediment using the UltraClean Soil DNA Isolation Kits (MoBio Laboratories, USA) for samples from 1993 and from 0.5 g of sediment using the MoBio Power Soil Kit (MoBio Laboratories, USA) for samples from 2012, using the protocols provided by the manufacturer; DNA was eluted in 60-100 µl Tris-EDTA-buffer and stored at -20°C. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was accomplished with 454 pyrosequencing technology, using primers covering the hypervariable V4-V6 region (530F GTGCCAGCMGCNGCGG, 1100R GGGTTNCGNTCGTTR). Sequencing was performed on a 454 GS FLX machine at the Research and Testing Laboratory, Texas.",

    "description": "The development of oil exploration activities and an increase in shipping in Arctic areas have elevated the risk of oil spills in this cold marine environment. The objective of this experimental study was to assess the effect of biostimulation on the microbial community abundance, structure, dynamics and metabolic potential for oil hydrocarbon degradation in oil-contaminated Arctic seawater. The combination of amplicon-based and shotgun sequencing together with genome-resolved metagenomics and omics data integration was applied for assessment of microbial community structure and metabolic properties in naphthenic crude oil-amended microcosms. Implementing biostimulation of seawater microbial community by addition of nutrients resulted in substantially elevated prokaryotic community abundance (103-fold), distinctly different bacterial community structure from initial seawater, 1.3-fold elevated normalized abundance of hydrocarbon degradation genes as well as enhanced biodegradation of crude oil by 12%. The analysis based on the integration of several microbial community structure estimates proved to be less prone to variations in individual taxa proportions estimates provided by different sequencing and taxonomic assignment methods, and produced consensus estimate of microbial community dynamics as well as effect of biostimulation on particular microbial taxa. The bacterial communities of biostimulated microcosms after four months of incubation were dominated by Gammaproteobacterial genera Pseudomonas, Marinomonas and Oleispira, succeeded by Cycloclasticus and Paraperlucidibaca after eight months of incubation. The majority of compiled 195 good quality metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) showcased versatile hydrocarbon degradation gene profiles. The results revealed that biostimulation with nutrients promotes naphthenic oil degradation in Arctic seawater, but this strategy alone might not be enough to achieve bioremediation goals efficiently and within a reasonable timeframe.",

Using high-throughput 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing, we have investigated the communities of a wide range of cryoconite holes from 15 locations across the Arctic and Antarctic. Through these methods we were able to determine the groups present the family and genus level. Cryoconite holes may be a global phenomenon, but they are inhabited and formed by regionally discrete communities. Our results are consistent with the notion that cryoconite microbiomes are adapted to differing conditions within the cryosphere, which has implications for the response of cryoconite to changing climates of the past and present.",

These two polar bear subpopulations occur in two distinct Arctic sea ice ecoregions, convergent (EG) and divergent (SB). Region-specific differences in sea ice decline patterns has led to differential use of sea ice habitat and has altered polar bear access to traditional ice-associated seal prey, particularly in the SB subpopulation found in the divergent ice ecoregion. Polar bears in this subpopulation have demonstrated increased use of terrestrial habitat and terrestrial-based food resources over the last decade or so, which has implications in terms of how this might impact their gut microbiome--an important aspect of host health.",

However, the generation of microdiversity in natural microbial communities remains poorly documented and understood to date. Here we show that strong environmental selection promotes microdiversity in the microbiome of glacier-fed streams (GFS). Using a novel method, we identified phylogenetic clades, mostly affiliated to Betaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria, under selection and driving community assembly. Several genera within these clades, all belonging to the core microbiome, exhibited a higher level of microdiversity than genera that were not under selection. Genera under selection were diverse, abundant and present in all GFS, indicative of their success to thrive in an extreme environment. Our findings demonstrate that strong selective forces, typical for extreme environments, push microbial diversity towards microdiversity residing within specific phylogenetic clades. Thus microdiversity, and therefore overall microbial diversity, in GFS may be under threat as the selective forces relax with glacier shrinkage.",

We provide evidence for novel archaea-host associations, including Bathyarchaeia and Methanothermobacter ー the latter of which was prevalent among Aves and correlated with body temperature. Host phylogeny more strongly explained archaeal diversity than diet, while specific taxa were associated with each factor. Co-phylogeny was significant and strongest for mammalian herbivores.

These blooms provide a plethora of algal derived carbon sources and thereby fuel the bacterial and archaeal communities within the sea ice.

The winter community was dominated by amplicon sequence variants of the Candidatus Nitrosopumilus and Gammaproteobacteria (Colvellia, Kangiellaceae, Nitrinocolaceae), indicating that sulfur- and nitrogen based metabolisms are more prevalent. Particularly ammonia oxidation to nitrate by Cand. Nitrosopumilus and subsequent nitrification replenishing the nitrate pool for sea-ice algal spring blooms. At the onset of the vernal sea-ice algae bloom the community shifted to a dominance of Gammaproteobacteria (Kangiellaceae, Nitrinocolaceae) and Bacteroidia (Polaribacter), as is commonly observed at lower latitudes during phytoplankton spring blooms, while Cand. Nitrosopumilus vanished. The PiCRUST predicted carbohydrate-active enzymes increased during spring and summer, as compared to winter, indicating that sea-ice algae derived carbon sources are a strong driver of bacterial and archaeal community succession in Arctic sea ice during the change of season. This implies an annual succession from a metabolically diverse winter community to a algal derived carbon sources based spring/ summer community.",

    "description": "To study microbial food web interactions grazer exclusion experiments were performed, where growth rates of different microbial groups in the absence of different grazers can be analysed. Surface water samples were gently reverse filtrated, using different mesh size filters (0.8, 3, 5, 10 and 90 μm), to retain organisms of different size fractions. After the filtration, water from every size fraction was transferred in 3.9L transparent polycarbonate bottles (Nalgene®) using silicone tubing and staggered filling. Experiment bottles were incubated at close to in situ temperatures and light conditions. During May and August incubations were placed in plexiglass tanks on deck with a continuously seawater flow through (May: 1.7 ± 1.6 °C and August: 1 ± 0.8 °C) and nylon wrapping around each bottle reduced PAR to 30% of surface irradiance. Incubations in January, March and November were placed in a dark cooling room at 2 °C, and only in March artificial light (5 μmol photons m-2 s-1) was supplied as in situ light cycle (16 h darkness and 8h light). Experiments were incubated for 5-10 days and samples for microbial abundance measurements taken daily and nutrient samples every second day. Samples for microbial community composition were taken at the start and end of the experiments in March, May, August and November.",

The melting ice exposes land for encroachment and diversification of bacterial communities promoting soil and vegetation development, thereby changing the ecosystem's functioning. Although studies have focused on macro-level deglaciation impacts, little is known about invasion and succession of bacterial community post deglaciation. Here, we provide meta-barcoding-based insight into bacterial community composition and their functional attributes across different retreating periods of Gangotri glacier in Himalaya. The findings of this study indicate that the bacterial communities inhabit, diversify and develop specialised functions post-deglaciation leading to nutrient inputs to soil and vegetation development, which may provide feedback to climate change.",

In this work, we studied the relationship between FTCs and soil bacteria in soil with different moisture content (field capacity, FC and saturated moisture content, SMC). The results showed that FTCs affected the richness and diversity of the soil bacterial community. Bacteria diversity were significantly affected after the second FTC. Thereafter, bacteria diversity with a saturated moisture content returned to the pre-freeze-thaw level, but the recovery of bacteria in soil with the field capacity was lower than that of the saturated moisture content. Frequent FTCs accelerate the turnover of DOC by affecting the carbon metabolism of microbial communities. Adjusting moisture to SMC can increase the stability of carbon.

In a greenhouse experiment, we grew seedlings representing different functional groups in tailings and glacial-till overburden from the Mount Polley Mine, Canada. We applied 5% (38 mL) and 25% (188 mL) forest soil additions for comparison with tailings/overburden controls and reference forest soil. The experiment was replicated with sterilized soil to isolate the biological effects of the forest soil from the physiochemical effects.

    "title": "Niche-specific profiling reveals transcriptional adaptations required for the cytosolic lifestyle of Salmonella enterica",
    "description": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is a zoonotic pathogen that causes diarrheal disease in humans and animals. During salmonellosis, S. Typhimurium colonizes epithelial cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. S. Typhimurium has an unusual lifestyle in epithelial cells that begins within an endocytic-derived Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV), followed by escape into the cytosol, epithelial cell lysis and bacterial release. The cytosol is a more permissive environment than the SCV and supports rapid bacterial growth. The physicochemical conditions encountered by S. Typhimurium within the cytosol, and the bacterial genes required for cytosolic colonization, remain unknown. Here we have exploited the parallel colonization strategies of S. Typhimurium in epithelial cells to decipher the two niche-specific bacterial virulence programs. By combining a population-based RNA-seq approach with single-cell microscopic analysis, we identified bacterial genes/sRNAs with cytosol-specific or vacuole-specific expression signatures. Using these genes/sRNAs as environmental biosensors, we defined that Salmonella is exposed to iron and manganese deprivation and oxidative stress in the cytosol and zinc and magnesium deprivation in the SCV. Furthermore, iron availability was critical for optimal S. Typhimurium replication in the cytosol, as well as entC, fepB, soxS and sitA-mntH. Virulence genes that are typically associated with extracellular bacteria, namely Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI1) and SPI4, had a cytosolic-specific expression profile. Our study reveals that the cytosolic and vacuolar S. Typhimurium virulence gene programs are unique to, and tailored for, residence within distinct intracellular compartments. Therefore, this archetypical vacuole-adapted pathogen requires extensive transcriptional reprogramming to successfully colonize the mammalian cytosol. Overall design: HeLa cells were pre-treated with either with Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS) to induce authphagy, or with wortmannin (WTM) to inhibit autophagy, then infected with Salmonella enterica servary Typhimurium strain SL1344. Intracellular bacteria were then isolated at 8 h post-infection, bacterial RNA was extracted, and RNA sequencing performed. Two replicates of each experiment were performed. Four samples were sequenced overall.",

    "description": "A genomic analysis study presents the whole-genome sequencing and annotation of Barrientosiimonas humi gen. nov., sp. nov. 39T to unravel the genomics data of B. humi sequences and understand the related biological functions information expression. Whole genome of B. humi isolate was sequenced using PacBio Sequel and then polished by Illumina HiSeq. The data was further undergone bioinformatic analysis for genome annotation. The circular genome of B. humi was then visualized. Totally, 83,639 reads were predicted from its 3.6Mb genome size. It composed of 3,381 coding genes, with about 95% were functionally annotated. B. humi was evident sharing close sequence similarity with species Demetria terragena and family Dermacoccaceae. Gene Ontology (GO) indicated cell and cell part were highly represented among cellular component, catalytic activity and binding were most enriched process within molecular function, metabolic process and cellular process were the top in biological process. Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) revealed metabolism related genes were highly enriched, mostly were mapped to amino acid transport metabolism, transcription, energy production and conversion. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) reported that metabolism process was the most represented KEGG pathways, which biosynthesis of antibiotics and metabolic pathways associated genes were significantly functioning. There were 52 biosynthetic gene clusters involved in secondary metabolites biosynthesis. We found that B. humi was capable to produce antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic and inhibitor bioactive compounds. The natural producer of multiple ectoine biosynthesis genes were expressed in B. humi genome region, which elucidating its potential to adapt and function in extreme environments. B. humi genomic sequence positions of the predicted coding regions were illustrated. Our research is the first whole-genome sequencing and annotation study in B. humi, which serves as a significant approach that offers comprehensive genomic data to accelerate the future studies of novel secondary metabolites extraction for innovative natural antibiotics and cancer drugs.",

TV is located near Broggerbreen glaciers (NG), whereas ST and KN located far from glaciers (FG). These lakes were dominated by Proteobacteriota, Cyanobacteria, Chloroflexi and Acidobacteriota phyla but differed in abundance pattern between lakes. At genera level, Sphingomonas and Pseudanabaena were highly enriched in TV sample, while RB41 and Gitts_GS_136 were dominant in ST and KN samples. Bacterial richness and diversity were lower and significantly different in TV than ST and KN. The Shannon diversity index were significantly different in TV compared to ST and KN.

The study consisted of eighteen replicates of soil samples collected directly underneath and > 3 m away from mountain birches (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) in two adjacent 55-year-old grazing regimes with or without summer grazing by reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). Soil sample collection took place in September 2019, and the samples included the upper 5 cm of the soil, including both litter and humus layers. Upon collection, the samples were freeze-dried, homogenized and characterized for fungal community composition in duplicate samples using high-throughput sequencing of ITS2 rDNA region.Analyses of the community data have been published in the article Reindeer control over subarctic treeline alters soil fungal communities with potential consequences for soil carbon storage by Henni Ylanne, Rieke L.

River flow conditions controlled the water-atmosphere gas exchange, the in-stream biogeochemistry and quality and quantity of organic substances in the river. The large river CO2 and CH4 emissions reached between 7% and 18% of the floodplain carbon fluxes. During spring, negligible abundances of methanogens and the organic carbon characteristics suggest that high river gas concentrations are mostly floodplain derived.

The reason for their sole presence in Antarctica is still debated as there is no definitive consensus on how only two unrelated flowering plants managed to establish a breeding population in this part of the World. In this study, we have explored and compared the rhizosphere and root-endosphere dwelling microbial community of C. quitensis and D. antarctica specimens sampled in maritime Antarctica from sites displaying contrasting edaphic characteristics. Bacterial phylogenetic diversity (high throughput 16S rRNA gene fragment targeted sequencing) and microbial metabolic activity (Biolog Ecoplates) with a geochemical soil background were assessed. Gathered data showed that the microbiome of C. quitensis root system was mostly sitedependent, displaying different characteristics in each of the examined locations. This plant tolerated an active bacterial community only in severe conditions (salt stress, nutrient depravation) while in other, more favorable circumstances it restricted microbial activity, with a possibility of microbivory-based nutrient acquisition. The microbial communities of D. antarctica showed a high degree of similarity between samples within a particular rhizocompartment. The grass endosphere was significantly enriched in plant beneficial taxa of the family Rhizobiaceae, which displayed obligatory endophyte characteristics, suggesting that at least part of this community is transmitted vertically. Ultimately, the ecological success of C. quitensis and D. antarctica in Antarctica might be largely attributed to their associations and management of root-associated microbiota.",

    "description": "100+ Algal genome project part-2 (ALG-ALL-CODE Project Part-II) Microalgae are integral primary producers for the global ecosystem and can produce diverse, commercially viable compounds. Due to their early recognition of potential value, thousands of species around the world have been acquired and maintained in collection centers. Many of these species' genomes hold the secrets to niche adaptation, salinity tolerance, toxic bloom formation, biotech commercialization, and bioremediation efforts, but few have been sequenced at the genomic level. To address this knowledge gap, we cultured and sequenced 100+ more microalgal species. Our culturing and sequencing project included Rhodophytes, Chlorophytes, Haptophytes, Cercozoans, and Chromophytes. Bioinformatics analyses of these assemblies reveals unique and shared genes, change in gene copy number, and lineage- and habitat-specific enrichment. We describe a vast network of endogenous viral elements characteristic of specific clades. We found core and accessory viral genes, incorporated into host microalgal genomes, consisting of diverse integral membrane proteins, including membrane transporters (sugars, amino acids, ions) and their linking ankyrins. These findings shed new light on the role of virus participation in microbial eukaryote speciation and help to clarify questions surrounding genomes from non-microalgal species, especially those from understudied clades and with essential roles in aquaculture, public safety, and bioremediation. The new genome collection will also facilitate research and utilization of non-model species, and their genes, with potential for biotech endeavors.",

As major contributors to methane emissions in natural environments, the microbial communities involved in methane production and oxidation deserve a special attention. Microbial diversity and activity are expected to be strongly affected by the already observed (and further predicted) temperature increase in high-latitude ecosystems, eventually resulting in disrupted feedback methane emissions. The METHANOBASE project has been designed to investigate the intricate relations between microbial diversity and methane emissions in Arctic, Subarctic and Subantarctic ecosystems, under natural (baseline) conditions and in response to simulated temperature increments. We report here a small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) analysis of lake sediments from austral lakes in Chile (Patagonia / Cape Horn).",

Plants alter soil biological communities, generating plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) that affect the performance of successive plants, influencing plant community assembly and successional trajectories. Yet, our understanding of how PSFs mediated by soil microbes influence succession is limited for primary successional systems and forest ecosystems, particularly for ectomycorrhizal plants. In a two-phase greenhouse experiment, we investigated the role of root fungal symbionts in PSFs promoting forest succession in primary successional mine reclamation materials and later successional forest soils.",

Due to its high vulnerability, this species needs urgent actions to restore its threatened forests. Therefore, root inoculation with harsh-adapted root endophytes influences two endangered tree species by improving its establishment under a restoration assay with evident application in a conservation initiative.

    "description": "Antarctica is one of the most physically and chemically demanding environments on Earth. Only 0.34% (44,000 km2) of the continent is seasonally or permanently free of ice. Ice-free areas include the lower-latitude Antarctic Peninsula on the West side, high-altitude mountain peaks of the Ellsworth and Transantarctic Mountains and of the highest mountains in East Antarctica, coastal sites, isolated nunataks, and the McMurdo Dry Valleys.Victoria Land covers a latitudinal gradient of approximately 8 grades, and extends from the Ross Sea to the edge of the Polar Plateau. It is one of the 15 biologically distinct, ice-free, Antarctic Conservation Biogeographic Regions (ACBRs), encompassing the continent and close-lying islands. This region hosts a wide range of different niches, with minimal human perturbations, suitable for microbial colonization. Antarctic soils contain a high level of microbial diversity, however limited attention has so far been given to microorganisms living in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems. With this study, we aimed to give new insights into Victoria Land soil ecosystems, providing an extensive characterization of bacteria associated to soils and BSCs along a wide latitudinal gradient, through the analysis of 60 samples from 14 localities. Microbiome sequencing was performed amplifying the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. The 14 localities were grouped in three macrohabitats, namely coastal sites, characterized by the presence of BSCs, inner sites in Dry Valleys with soils without evident colonizations and a third site close to the \"Mario Zucchelli\" Italian Base, named \"Icarus Camp\", where samples were collected from initial steps of a surface alteration of granite sheets slightly sloping towards the sea.",

Front. Microbiol. 14:1154815. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2023.1154815 A major challenge in microbial ecology is to understand the principles and processes by which microbes associate and interact in community assemblages. Microbial communities in mountain glaciers are unique as first colonizers and nutrient enrichment drivers for downstream ecosystems. However, mountain glaciers have been distinctively sensitive to climate perturbations and have suffered a severe retreat over the past forty years, compelling us to understand glacier ecosystems before their disappearance. This is the first study in an Andean glacier in Ecuador offering insights into the relationship of physicochemical variables and altitude on the diversity and structure of bacterial communities. Our study covered extreme Andean altitudes at the Cayambe Volcanic Complex, from 4,783 to 5,583 masl. Glacier soil and ice samples were used as the source for 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries. We found (1) effects of altitude on diversity and community structure, (2) the presence of few significantly correlated nutrients to community structure, (3) sharp differences between glacier soil and glacier ice in diversity and community structure, where, as quantified by the Shannon gamma-diversity distribution, the meta-community in glacier soil showed more diversity than in glacier ice; this pattern was related to the higher variability of the physicochemical distribution of variables in the former substrate, and (4) significantly abundant genera associated with either high or low altitudes that could serve as biomarkers for studies on climate change. Our results provide the first assessment of these unexplored communities, before their potential disappearance due to glacier retreat and climate change.",

The two-factor sampling design used in this study allowed us to describe to which extent the Antarctic environments have influenced host-microbiome relationship. Specifically, the selection of two couple of co-generic species from two distant bioregions helped us in the quantification of the relative role of two possible major evolutionary drivers responsible for shaping Collembola microbiomes in Antarctica: i.e. the phylogenetic similarity of hosts and/or the distinct biogeographic region of origin.",

Carbon and nitrogen cycling in Yedoma permafrost controlled by microbial functional limitations, Nature Geoscience, 2020.  Warming-induced microbial decomposition of organic matter in permafrost soils constitutes a climate-change feedback of uncertain magnitude. While physicochemical constraints on soil functioning are relatively well understood, the constraints attributable to microbial community composition remain unclear. Here we show that biogeochemical processes in permafrost can be impaired by missing functions in the microbial community—functional limitations—probably due to environmental filtering of the microbial community over millennia-long freezing. We inoculated Yedoma permafrost with a functionally diverse exogenous microbial community to test this mechanism by introducing potentially missing microbial functions. This initiated nitrification activity and increased CO2 production by 38% over 161 days. The changes in soil functioning were strongly associated with an altered microbial community composition, rather than with changes in soil chemistry or microbial biomass. The present permafrost microbial community composition thus constrains carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical processes, but microbial colonization, likely to occur upon permafrost thaw in situ, can alleviate such functional limitations. Accounting for functional limitations and their alleviation could strongly increase our estimate of the vulnerability of permafrost soil organic matter to decomposition and the resulting global climate feedback.",

Samples were obtained using either push cores by SCUBA divers from the Argentinian Diving Division or with a sediment corer (UWITEC, Austria). Live samples were stored at 2 degrees C (near in situ temperature) until transport to the home laboratory where they were used for incubation experiments. The data in this project supports two studies: (1) Investigation of the effect of macroalgae (as pool of organic matter) and AQDS (humic substance analog) on iron reduction and associated microorganisms using slurry incubations and RNA-stable isotope probing with 13C-labeled acetate or bicarbonate. Activities in sediment from two different sampling locations (STA10, STA14) were compared. (2) Identifying acetate utilizing iron reducers with RNA-stable isotope probing in sediments located closely at the terminating glacier (STA13).",

    "description": "The current warming scenario in the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) has multiple effects on the marine ecosystem, modifying the trophic chain and the nutrient regime. In Chile Bay (Greenwich Island, WAP), the effect of the decrease in surface salinity on the marine microbial community as a consequence of freshening from nearby glaciers, was analyzed by 16S rRNA-Tag sequencing and metatranscriptomics, together with isotopic rates of carbon and nitrogen. Marine transects along the bay, glacier-ice sampling, and manipulated salinity microcosm experiments were conducted during the austral summer of 2016. The results reveal that certain common seawater genera such as Polaribacter, Pseudoalteromonas, and HTCC2207 respond positively to downward changes in salinity in both, bay transect and manipulated experiments. These bacteria slightly decrease their relative abundance, but they still have the ability to develop their functional activities over time. However, other bacteria common on ice, such as Flavobacterium and Polaromonas eventually disappear from the marine system in response to the increased salinity in this system compared to ice. We suggest that all these bacterial members would be defined as potential sentinels of freshening events in the Antarctic coastal system. Furthermore, within photosynthetic eukaryotes there are also members that respond positively to the decrease in salinity, not affecting carbon fixation rates and guaranteeing optimal primary production in the bay. These results suggest that a significant part of the microbial community in Chile Bay, and possible in other coastal areas of Antarctica, are resilient and adapted to disturbances such as freshening due to the warming effect of climate change in Antarctica.",

    "description": "Shallow thermokarst ponds are a conspicuous landscape element of the Arctic Siberian tundra with high biogeochemical variability. Little is known about how microbes from the regional species pool assemble into local pond communities, and how the resulting patterns affect functional properties such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) remineralization and greenhouse gas (GHG) turnover. We analysed the pelagic microbiomes of 20 ponds in north-eastern Siberia in the context of their physico-chemical properties. Ponds were categorized as polygonal or trough according to their geomorphological origin. The diversity of bacteria and eukaryotic microbes was assessed by ribosomal gene tag sequencing. Null model analysis revealed an important role of stochastic assembly processes within ponds of identical origin, in particular for genotypes only occurring in few systems. Nevertheless, the two pond types clearly represented distinct niches for both the bacterial and eukaryotic microbial communities. Carbon dioxide concentration, indicative of heterotrophic microbial processes, varied greatly, especially in the trough ponds. Methane concentrations were lower in polygonal ponds and were correlated with the estimated abundance of methanotrophs. Thus, the overall functional variability of Arctic ponds reflects the stochastic assembly of their microbial communities. Distinct functional subcommunities can, nevertheless, be related to GHG concentrations.",

    "description": "The intestinal microbiota is significantly affected by the external environment, but our understanding of the effects of extreme environments such as Antarctica is far from adequate. In this study, we selected five representative time points: living in Antarctica for 2 months (summer, T1), 5 months (before-wintering, T2), 8 months (mid-wintering, T3), 11 months (the end of wintering, T4) and 7 months after returning to China (T5), and compared the gut microbiota and clinical indexes. The results showed that the Antarctic environment has a profound impact on the intestinal microbiota and blood clinical indexes of individuals, and this effect may persist for quite a long time even after leaving Antarctic. The T5 group were also clustered near T4 instead of T1. Notably, T2, T3 and T4 are more clustered compared with the T1 group. At the phylum level, the main dominant bacteria in the population are Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, with average proportions of 0.79, 0.12, 0.06, and 0.02, respectively, showing a western-style dietary microbiota composition. Compared with that in the T2, T4 and T5 groups, the relative abundance of Actinobacteria was significantly increased in the T1 and T3 groups. At the genus level, we found a genus with a step-like increase in the content of the genus-Alistipes, and it decreased significantly after returning to the normal environment. In the T2 group and T3 group, some clinical indexes such as TT4, ALT, UA, Scr, CysC, TC, HDL, APOA1 and APOB, their values are higher than T1, T4 and T5 group. This may be caused by cold and a diet based on meat. The probiotic, Pseudobutyrivibrio is negatively related to SCR, TC, LDL, APOB.

The result of plant stress on microbial communities has shown that some taxa increase in stress response but overall effects on microbial diversity have not been characterized. In this work, we performed a systematic study using 4 adverse growth treatments across 2 soil conditions to determine effect of plant stress on microbiome diversity. Whether the initial diversity was high (wild soil) or low (autoclaved control), we observed a decrease in overall diversity in both root and rhizosphere compartments. This work suggests that the stress response of Setaria viridis results in lower ecosystem microbial diversity. Coupled with the ability of the microbiome to confer stress resistiance this suggests a negative feedback on ecosystem microbial diversity when plants are grown under increasingly adverse growth conditions, suggesting potential implications for plant and soil health in response to climate change.",

    "description": "Polar regions provide an ideal environmental setting to investigate the succession of bacterial communities. Especially, Arctic terrestrial ecosystems are constantly undergoing rapid changes due to global warming, resulting in the increase of average Arctic temperatures twice the global average for the past 50 years. When a glacier is retreating, new landscapes are exposed that have been previously locked under the ice for thousands of years, providing an opportunity for colonization and succession process of various lifeforms in time and space. In glacier foreland ecosystems, microbes play an important role in modulating the vegetation structure during the colonization, whilst plants influence and recruit their own symbiotic communities through rhizosphere, which in turn participate in biogeochemical processes in the high latitude regions. In the present study, we investigated the bacterial community structure of Midtree Lovenbreen glacier foreland ecosystem using chrono sequence approach. Samples were collected from the glacier foreland associated with Midtre Lovenbreen glacier, Svalbard during the year of 2019 Indian Arctic expedition . A total of 8 soil samples were collected on a transect by using Chronosequence approach from glacier snout to fjord, which was about 1.8 km covering deglaciation time period up to 1900 years. We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing based approaches using Illumina paired end sequencing to delineate the bacterial community composition associated with glacier foreland ecosystem.",

    "description": "Changes in the net radiative forcing of greenhouse gas emissions from Arctic soils in response to warming and permafrost thaw will depend on the balance of CO2 and CH4 emitted during anaerobic organic matter decomposition. While soil water content limits aerobic respiration, the factors controlling methanogenesis and anaerobic respiration are poorly defined in suboxic Arctic soils. We conducted incubation experiments on two Alaskan soils with contrasting pH and geochemistry to determine the pathways of anaerobic microbial respiration and predict changes with increasing substrate availability upon warming. In the circumneutral Teller soil incubations, the ratio of CO2 to CH4 dropped rapidly from 10 to <2 after 60 days, indicating alternative terminal electron acceptors (TEAs) were rapidly consumed. In contrast, the ratio in the acidic Council soil remained above 4, indicating pathways other than methanogenesis contributed to CO2 production. Relatively small changes in dissolved Fe(II), NO3-, and SO42- concentrations suggest alcohol fermentation or respiration using organic TEAs. In the Teller soil, acetate stimulated production of CO2 and CH4 in a nearly 1:1 ratio, indicating methanogenesis rather than respiration. However, acetate addition to the Council soil reduced both CO2 and CH4 production, but fermentative bacteria increased in relative abundance. Selective inhibition of methanogens did not increase respiration. The response of CO2 and CH4 production to increased substrate availability in wet Arctic soils will vary widely depending on soil geochemistry: acidic soils with alternative TEAs may experience smaller changes than circumneutral soils with low TEA availability, which could become much larger sources of CH4.",

The primary biology in this system is microbial. Linking a range of high-resolution remote sensing data with over 600 person days in the field, the 220 km2 3 valley NZTABS survey now includes over 650 spatially strategic soil samples targeting the diversity habitats in the system. Each sample and site has been analyzed for a range of geochemistry as well as a comprehensive survey of biology (all visible vegetation, insects, all infauna and flora (nematodes, rotifers, tartigrades), and microbiology). The initial microbial surveys (Bacteria, Cyanobacteria, fungi) were carried only using DNA fingerprinting analysis. All of the information has been placed into and interactive GIS framework allowing direct relationships between all parameters to be queried. The central objective of the survey is to determine the primary environmental drivers for structuring the biology to enable us to develop a model that can predict the distribution of biology across the entire Dry Valley system (6500 km2) using only remote sensing. Ultimately we hope that the model will be able to identify areas of sensitivity or unusual complexity that should be protected.",

    "title": "Impact of fire on active layer and permafrost microbial communities and metagenomes in an upland Alaskan boreal forest.",
    "description": "Permafrost soils are large reservoirs of potentially labile carbon (C). Understanding the dynamics of C release from these soils requires us to account for the impact of wildfires, which are increasing in frequency as the climate changes. Boreal wildfires contribute to global emission of greenhouse gases (GHG-CO2, CH4 and N2O) and indirectly result in the thawing of near-surface permafrost. In this study, we aimed to define the impact of fire on soil microbial communities and metabolic potential for GHG fluxes in samples collected up to 1 m depth from an upland black spruce forest near Nome Creek, Alaska. We measured geochemistry, GHG fluxes, potential soil enzyme activities and microbial community structure via 16SrRNA gene and metagenome sequencing. We found that soil moisture, C content and the potential for respiration were reduced by fire, as were microbial community diversity and metabolic potential. There were shifts in dominance of several microbial community members, including a higher abundance of candidate phylum AD3 after fire. The metagenome data showed that fire had a pervasive impact on genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, methanogenesis and the nitrogen cycle. Although fire resulted in an immediate release of CO2 from surface soils, our results suggest that the potential for emission of GHG was ultimately reduced at all soil depths over the longer term. Because of the size of the permafrost C reservoir, these results are crucial for understanding whether fire produces a positive or negative feedback loop contributing to the global C cycle.",

    "description": "In this study, the early ecological succession patterns of Forni Glacier (Ortles-Cevedale group, Italian Alps) forefield along a 18-year long chronosequence (with a temporal resolution of one year) has been reported. Bacterial and fungal community structures were inferred by high throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and ITS, respectively. Besides, the occurrence of both herbaceous and arboreous plants was also recorded at each plot. A significant decrease of alpha-diversity in more recently deglaciated areas was observed for both bacteria and plants. Time since glacier retreat and pH affected the structure of both fungal and bacterial communities. Pioneer plants could be a major source of colonization for both bacterial and fungal communities. Consistently, some bacterial taxa (among those significantly varying with pH along the chronosequence) are known to be actively involved in rock-weathering processes due to their chemolithotrofic metabolism, thus suggesting that the early phase of the chronosequence could be mainly shaped by the biologically controlled bioavailability of metals and inorganic compounds. Fungal communities were dominated by ascomycetous filamentous fungi and basidiomycetous yeasts. Their role as cold-adapted organic matter decomposers, due to their heterotrophic metabolism, was suggested.",

    "description": "A surprising diversity and abundance of microorganisms resides in the cold desert soils of Antarctica. The metabolic processes that sustain them, however, are poorly understood. In this study, we used metagenomic and biogeochemical approaches to study the microbial communities in 16 physicochemically diverse mountainous and glacial soils from remote sites in South Victoria Land, north of the Mackay Glacier. We assembled 451 metagenome-assembled genomes from 18 bacterial and archaeal phyla, constituting the largest resource of Antarctic soil microbial genomes to date. The most abundant and prevalent microorganisms are metabolically versatile aerobes that use atmospheric hydrogen and carbon monoxide to meet energy, carbon, and, through metabolic water production, hydration needs. Phylogenetic analysis and structural modelling infer that bacteria from nine phyla can scavenge atmospheric hydrogen using a previously unreported enzyme family, the group 1l [NiFe]-hydrogenases. Consistently, gas chromatography measurements confirmed most soils rapidly consume atmospheric hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and provide the first experimental evidence of methane oxidation in non-maritime Antarctica. We also recovered genomes of microorganisms capable of oxidizing other inorganic compounds, including nitrogen, sulfur, and iron compounds, as well as harvesting solar energy via photosystems and novel microbial rhodopsins. Bacterial lineages defined by symbiotic lifestyles, including Patescibacteria, Chlamydiae, and predatory Bdellovibrionota, were also surprisingly abundant. We conclude that the dominant microorganisms in Antarctic soils adopt mixotrophic strategies for energy and sometimes carbon acquisition, though they co-exist with diverse bacteria and archaea that adopt more specialist lifestyles. These unprecedented insights and associated genome compendium will inform efforts to protect biodiversity in this continent.",

All soils are formed from the same substrate and have a similar topographic position. For microbiological analysis, we extracted triplicates of total genomic DNA from 0.5 g of soil of each depth increment. We applied qPCR and HiSeq 16S rRNA amplicon analysis. All soil profiles were dominated by bacterial phyla such as Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Chloroflexi. Multiple clusters of abundant OTUs depending on the site-specific characteristics and depth were detected. Changes in soil properties were accompanied by changes in microbial abundances, microbial community compositions, and plant coverage.",

We sampled this site as part of a multi-week workshop for undergraduates with the goal of isolating, screening, and characterizing subarctic soil bacteria with antibiotic activity against ESKAPE pathogen relatives. The ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.) are the leading cause of nosocomial infections worldwide and a major public health threat due to their ability to rapidly develop multi-drug resistance to the safest antibiotics used clinically (Santajit and Indrawattana 2016). Discovering novel antibiotic activity against the ESKAPE pathogens is therefore critical in tackling the global antibiotic resistance crisis. Although Pseudomonas spp. found in soils have been previously established as prolific antibiotic producers (Gross &amp; Loper 2009), the isolates described here originated from subarctic soils that are not well categorized and therefore may be a segway into the discovery of novel antibiotic biosynthesis with activity against ESKAPE pathogens.",

Recent successful glacier related applications (e.g. ice sheets, ice lake and cryoconite holes) inspire us to performing in situ melting water sequencing at Qilian Mountain, China. Our findings suggest it may not be safe to consume melting water directly without further treatment in field; and despite only several hundred meters apart, the microbial ecology and functionalities differentiate on three sampling sites. Variety of chaperons that facilitate protein folding, cold shock, tRNA species, oxidative stress, sulfur oxidation and nitrification pathways, heavy metal pumps and resistance to toxic compounds etc. were all noticed in this study, which are highly consistent with other glacier related sequencing works. We have also shown Nanopore metagenomics sequencing can provide comparable prokaryotic classifications on phylum level within or among studies, encouraging more applications in field given much faster turnaround time.

Abiotic conditions and the interactions between above- and belowground biota drive soil responses to environmental change but these (a)biotic interactions are challenging to study. Nonetheless, better understanding of these interactions would improve predictions of future soil functioning and the soil-climate feedback and, in this context, permafrost soils are of particular interest due to their vast soil C-stores. We need new tools to isolate abiotic (microclimate, chemistry) and biotic (roots, fauna, microorganisms) components and to identify their respective roles in soil processes. We developed a new experimental setup, in which we mimic thermokarst (permafrost thaw-induced soil subsidence) by fitting thawed permafrost and vegetated active layer sods side by side into mesocosms deployed in a subarctic tundra over two growing seasons. In each mesocosm, the two sods were separated from each other by barriers with different mesh sizes to allow varying degrees of physical connection and, consequently, (a)biotic exchange between active layer and permafrost. We demonstrate that our mesh-approach succeeded in controlling 1) lateral exchange of solutes between the two soil types, 2) colonization of permafrost by microbes but not by soil fauna, and 3) ingrowth of roots into permafrost. In particular, experimental thermokarst induced a ~ 60% decline in permafrost nitrogen (N) content, a shift in soil bacteria and a rapid buildup of root biomass (+ 33.2 g roots m-2 soil). This indicates that cascading plant-soil-microbe linkages are at the heart of biogeochemical cycling in thermokarst events. We propose that this novel setup can be used to explore the effects of (a)biotic ecosystem components on focal biogeochemical processes in permafrost soils and beyond.",

    "description": "Effects of atmospheric warming are particularly pronounced on mountain regions of the world, including the European Alps. As the thawing rate of mountain permafrost ice is lower than for glacier ice, a progressive shift from glacial to periglacial dynamics is predicted for Alpine landscapes during the 21 st century in relation to deglaciation. Despite the growing literature on the impacts of deglaciation on Alpine hydrology and ecosystems, chemical and biological features of waters emerging from Alpine rock glaciers (i.e. permafrost landforms composed by a mixture of ice and debris) have been poorly investigated so far, while knowledge on microbial biodiversity of glacial headwaters is still sparse. A set of glacier- and permafrost-fed headwaters was investigated in the Central Italian Alps in late summer 2016, aiming at exploring bacterial community composition and diversity in epilithic biofilm and surface sediments in relation to water origin andchemical properties. Rock glacier-fed waters showed enhanced conductivity and trace element concentrations, and their highly diverse bacterial assemblages significantly differed from those detected in glacial streams, although no bacteria taxa exclusive for rockglacier-fed were detected.Bacterial taxonomical composition appeared to be related to water and sample type, as well as to water chemical properties, especially including concentrations of nutrients and trace metals. The results outline the need of further research aimed at understanding the role of environmental features in modulating bacterial diversity of Alpine headwaters affected by deglaciation.",

    "description": "Climate warming is leading to changes in the hydrology of glacier-fed catchments around the world. The influence of this on the export of microbial assemblages from glacial and downstream habitats is expected to impact the ecology of adjoining ecosystems. Currently the source of exported assemblages is poorly understood, yet this information may be critical for understanding how continued and elevated glacial melt may impact downstream environments. Here we report on the connectivity and temporal variability of microbiota sampled from a glacial catchment. We find that microbial habitats within glacial catchments are biologically connected through hydrological flow paths, leading to a cumulative system, with increased prokaryotic abundance and diversity as meltwaters travel downstream. Snow assemblages changed markedly throughout the sample period, likely reflecting changes in the surrounding environment. Changes in supraglacial meltwater assemblages reflected the transition of the glacial surface from snow covered to bare ice. Marked snowmelt across the periglacial environment resulted in a flushing of soil assemblages into the riverine system. In contrast, ice and subglacial meltwaters remained relatively stable. Our results are indicative that changes in glacial melt will influence the abundance and diversity of microbial assemblages transported downstream.",

Here we show that red snow, a common algal habitat blooming after the onset of melting, plays a crucial role in decreasing albedo. Our data reveal that red pigmented snow algae are cosmopolitan as well as independent of location specific geochemical and mineralogical factors. The patterns for snow algal diversity, pigmentation, and consequently albedo, are ubiquitous across the Arctic and the reduction in albedo accelerates snow melt and increases the time and area of exposed bare ice. We estimated that the overall decrease in snow albedo by red pigmented snow algal blooms over the course of one melt season can be 13%. This will invariably result in higher melt rates. We argue that such a ‘bio-albedo’ effect has to be considered in climate models.",

    "description": "Abatus agassizii is an irregular sea urchin species which inhabits shallow waters of the Weddell sea in Antarctica. As a deposit-feeder, A. agassizii nutrition relies on the ingestion of the surrounding sediment in which it lives barely burrowed. Despite the low complexity of its feeding habit, it harbours a long and twice-looped digestive tract suggesting that it may host complex bacterial community. Here we characterized the gut microbiota of two A. agassizii populations at the south of the King George Island in the West Antarctic Peninsula. Using an amplicon sequencing approach targeting the 16S rRNA gene, the goals of this study were to explore the Abatus microbiota composition and functional capacity, evaluating its compartmentalization among the gut content and the gut membrane in comparison with the external sediment. Additionally, we aimed to define a core gut microbiota between A. agassizii populations to identify potential keystone bacteria taxa. Lastly, we examined the keystone taxa micro-diversity looking for compartment specialization pattern at the oligotype scale. Our results show that the diversity and the structure of the microbiota were mostly driven by the compartments, and in a lesser extent by the population site. Differential enrichments in specific bacterial taxa were observed in the gut content and the gut membrane. Predictive functional profiles revealed a marked compartmentalization of the microbiota with higher abundance in specific pathways as the sulfur cycle in the gut content and the amino acid metabolism. Further, the definition of a core microbiota allowed the identification of shared potential keystone taxa assigned to the Desulfobacula and Spirochaeta genera, and evidence of compartmentalization at a high taxonomic resolution (>97% sequence similarity of the 16S rRNA gene) has been observed. The ecological relevance of these keystone taxa is in the host metabolism is discussed.",

    "description": "Diet and host phylogeny drive the taxonomic and functional content of the gut microbiome in mammals, yet it is unknown whether these patterns hold across all vertebrate lineages. Here we assess gut microbiomes from ~900 vertebrate species, including 315 mammals and 491 birds, assessing contributions of diet, phylogeny, and physiology to structuring gut microbiomes. In most non-flying mammals, strong correlations exist between microbial community similarity, host diet, and host phylogenetic distance up to the host order level. In birds, by contrast, gut microbiomes are only very weakly correlated to diet or host phylogeny. Furthermore, while most microbes resident in mammalian guts are present in only a restricted taxonomic range of hosts, most microbes recovered from birds show little evidence of host specificity. Notably, among the mammals, bats host especially bird-like gut microbiomes, with little evidence for correlation to host diet or phylogeny. Thus suggests that host-gut microbiome phylosymbiosis depends on factors convergently absent in birds and bats, potentially associated with physiological adaptations to flight. Our findings expose major variations in the behavior of these important symbioses in endothermic vertebrates, and may signal fundamental evolutionary shifts in the costs/benefit framework of the gut microbiome.",

In this study, we sampled the Icelandic groundwater, which is unique in that it has been separated and isolated into distinct basins for millions of years due to volcanic activity. The aim was to explore the fungal diversity of the basins and its connection with the surface waters. We screened the DNA-based fungal diversity of eleven Icelandic groundwater springs and their emerging surface waters by ITS metabarcoding, revealing that the species turnover was indeed distinct for each groundwater basin. Furthermore, the groundwater taxa, which include many (psychrophilic) yeast-like and ascomycete fungi, appear to serve as a constant inoculum for the surface water. Nevertheless, the groundwater springs had a lower sequence proportion of early diverging, primary aquatic fungal lineages (10%) and completely unknown lineages (13%) than the surface waters (41% and 22%, respectively). This could be explained by the lower diversity of suitable hosts for these presumed parasitic lineages. Our results highlight the importance of overlooked organism groups in the resolution of overarching research questions in ecology, nutrient circulation, and global change biology at large.",

    "description": "Deep-sea environments can get contaminated with recalcitrant petroleum hydrocarbons through different anthropogenic activities. The effects of the hydrostatic pressure in the deep sea on microbial oil degradation, the option of choice for full remediation of these environments, is poorly understood. Moreover, efficient piezotolerant oil degraders, i.e. interesting bioaugmentation candidates, have been rarely isolated so far. Here we performed long-term enrichments (100 days) of sediment taken from a natural cold seep while providing optimal conditions to sustain high hydrocarbon degradation rates (i.e. oxygen, mesophilic temperatures [20°C] and medium chain alkanes [dodecane] in abundance). Through enrichments performed at high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) [10 MPa] and ambient pressure (AP) [0.1 MPa] and by using control enrichments with marine broth, we demonstrated that both pressure and carbon source can have a big impact on community structure. In contrast to previous studies, hydrocarbonoclastic OTUs remained dominant at both AP and HHP, suggesting piezotolerance of these OTUs over the supplied pressure range. Twenty-three isolates were obtained after isolation and dereplication using matrix-assisted laser deionisation/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). After re-cultivation at HHP, strain R-72943, a hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium identified as Alcanivorax venustensis, showed promising piezotolerance in axenic culture as well. Furthermore, preliminary co-cultivation tests showed synergistic growth between some isolates, a promising result for future bioaugmentation tools. Overall, more insight into the effect of HHP on oil degrading communities was obtained as well as several interesting isolates, among others a piezotolerant Alcanivorax, with which future deep-sea synthetic community remediation could be further investigated.",

    "description": "A major goal of marine microbial ecology is to understand how the environment structures microbiomes, and how community functions impact ocean biogeochemistry. Direct measurements of protein profiles through time reflect physiological functions of microbiomes and their adaptations to, and modifications of, local chemical gradients. We examined metaproteomes from two Arctic microbiomes during shipboard incubations to track early functional and taxonomic responses to simulated algal blooms and an oligotrophic control. Using a novel peptide-based enrichment analysis, significant changes (p-value < 0.01) in biological and molecular functions associated with carbon and nitrogen recycling were observed. Within the first day under both organic matter conditions, Bering Strait surface microbiomes increased protein synthesis, carbohydrate degradation and cellular redox processes while decreasing C1 metabolism. Taxonomic assignments revealed that the core microbiome collectively responded to algal substrates by synthesizing carbon prior to select taxa utilizing and reallocating nitrogen intracellularly. Incubations of Chukchi Sea bottom-water microbiomes showed similar, but temporally delayed, functional responses to identical conditions. This unbiased analysis of the dynamic responses of two oceanic microbiomes has important implications for timing and magnitude of bacterial responses to organic perturbations within the Arctic Ocean, and demonstrates how community-level functions could contribute to predicting biogeochemical gradients in oceans.",

While many studies identify pH as a major parameter structuring microbial communities at large spatial scales, many other variables impact distribution patterns on smaller scales. Here, we investigated the biogeographical patterns of Arctic soil microbial communities from 1 m to 500 m, within Adventdalen, Svalbard, using 16S sequencing, gravimetric measurements and X-ray fluorescence. Multivariate analyses identified key environmental variables shaping microbial communities and revealed the importance of soil moisture, organic carbon and elements such as aluminum, calcium and potassium in structuring distribution patterns. The indicator species analyses identified key associations between environmental variables and OTUs. Using geostatistical kriging, we mapped the biodiversity and distribution of key OTUs across the landscape. Overall, our results highlight the spatial heterogeneity in Arctic soils and identifies the sampling scale needed to characterize microbial communities within an area of interest with seemingly homogeneous landscapes.",

    "description": "This is a large scale project with the sequencing co-funded by collaborators at the University of Cape Town and WT Core (I2818). This is a project aimed at deepening our understanding of pneumococcal evolution and transmission dynamics through analysis of genomes from a large scale, deeply sampled pneumococcal population. It is based on a longitudinal carriage study conducted in the Drakenstein district near Cape Town, South Africa that has parallels with, and valuable differences from, the earlier longitudinal carriage study in the Maela refugee camp in North West Thailand. The primary aim of the “Drakenstein Child Health Study” (DCHS) is to longitudinally investigate aetiology, progression and risk factors for childhood pneumonia in a cohort of 1000 mother-infant pairs over a period of 5 years. A subset of 800 infants has been intensively sampled at fortnightly intervals during their first year of life. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs are collected every second week during the first year of life, during scheduled clinic visits at 6, 12, 18, 24 months of age and during any episode of pneumonia. The two-weekly sampling is a key difference from Maela where sampling was monthly and will enhance our ability to detect transmission events, particularly the early transmissions between mother and infant. Samples are linked to a very detailed set of metadata, including a range of relevant exposures (e.g., antimicrobial therapy, vaccination status, mode of delivery, socio-economic conditions, air quality, parental drug and alcohol abuse) and outcome (e.g., LRTI, wheezing illness, growth, lung function) variables. To date, more than 900 episodes of LRTI have been documented in this cohort. Detailed etiological investigation, including 33-plex qPCR for a range of respiratory pathogens has been completed on all samples collected at the time of pneumonia, and in a subset of NP samples over the 3-months preceding the LRTI event. Overall the study has collected 12,000 pneumococcal isolates. We would like to sequence all 12,000 available isolates to maximise the statistical power of analyses.",

Identifying specific antibiotic resistant microbes is essential for quick and appropriate treatment. Increased antibiotic resistance in the environment may limit treatment options for infections. As the climate changes and permafrost thaws, antibiotic resistant microbes may multiply at an increased rate. Multidrug resistance genes are often found on plasmids, enabling the rapid sharing via horizontal gene transfer. Using culture-based methods, we found widespread antibiotic resistance along with heavy metal tolerance in local boreal forest soils affected by thawing permafrost. We sequenced our cultured bacteria using Oxford Nanopore MinION to generate long-reads. We assembled and polished our genome followed by annotation. We identify individual resistance genes present in our samples. Importantly, these methods allow us to better understand the environmental reservoir of antibiotic resistance in Alaska.",

    "description": "This study includes sequencing data from Bacillus anthracis strains isolated during an outbreak of anthrax on the Yamal Peninsula in the summer of 2016 and independently in Yakutia in 2015. A common feature of these strains is their conservation in permafrost, from which they were extracted either due to the thawing of permafrost (Yamal strains) or as the result of paleontological excavations (Yakut strains). All strains isolated on the Yamal share an identical genotype belonging to lineage B.Br.001/002, pointing to a common source of infection in a territory over 250 km in length. In contrast, during the excavation in Yakutia, three genetically different strains were recovered from a single pit. One strain belongs to B.Br.001/002, as the Yamal strains. Despite the remoteness of Yamal from Yakutia, whole genome sequence analysis showed that the B.Br.001/002 strains are very closely related. The two other strains contribute to two different branches of A.Br.008/011, one of the remarkable polytomies described so far in the B. anthracis population. The geographic distribution of the strains belonging to this polytomy is suggesting that this polytomy emerged in the thirteenth century, in combination with the constitution of a unified Mongol empire extending from China to Eastern Europe. We propose an evolutionary model for B. anthracis recent evolution in which the B lineage spread throughout Eurasia and was subsequently replaced by the A lineage except in some geographically isolated areas.

    "description": "We used amplicon sequencing and isolation of fungi from in-growth mesh bags to identify active fungi in three earliest stages of soil development (SSD) at a glacier forefield (0-3, 9-14, 18-25 years). Soil organic matter and nutrient concentrations were extremely low, but the fungal diversity was still high (220 OTUs / 138 cultivated OTUs). A clear successional trend was observed along SSDs, and species richness increased with time. Distinct changes in fungal community composition occurred with the advent of vascular plants. Fungal communities of recently de-glaciated soil are most distinctive, and rather similar to communities typical for cryoconite or ice. This indicates that melting water is an important inoculum for native soil. Moreover, communities growing in snow-free soil are significantly different from those growing in the snow-covered soil. Some fungal taxa, especially of the class Microbotryomycetes, showed a clear preference for winter and early SSD. Our results provide insight into new facets regarding the ecology of fungal taxa, e.g. by showing an alternative, saprobial lifestyle in snow-covered soil for representatives of biotrophic plant pathogens belonging to class Pucciniomycetes. The isolated fungi include a large proportion of unknown species, which can now be formally described and used for experimental approaches.",

    "description": "Permafrost thaw is leading to rapid shifts in boreal ecosystem function. Permafrost thaw affects soil carbon turnover through changes in soil hydrology, however, the biotic mechanisms regulating plant community response remain elusive. Here, we measured the response of fungal community composition and soil nutrient content in an intact permafrost plateau forest soil and an adjacent thermokarst bog using barcoded amplicon targeting ITS2 and 28S rRNA genes. Next, we used the soils from the permafrost plateau and the thermokarst bog as soil inoculum in a greenhouse experiment to measure whether shifts in fungal community and soil water level regulate plant productivity. Overall, we found that fungal community composition differed significantly between the thawed and intact permafrost sites, but soil nutrient content did not. Relative abundance of mycorrhizal fungal taxa decreased while relative abundance of putative fungal pathogens increased with permafrost thaw. In the greenhouse, we found that ecto- and arbuscular associated host plants had higher productivity in permafrost-intact soils relative to thawed soils. However, productivity of non-mycorrhizal tussock grass was more affected by soil water levels than soil communities. Our results suggest that fungal communities are crucial in mediating plant response to permafrost thaws inducing hydrology changes.",

    "description": "We identify bacterial communities in Antarctic surface snow and evaluate cell viability, assess the presence of relic DNA, and determine the impact of human presence on otherwise pristine ecosystems. By sampling a transect from the South Orkney Islands to the Ellsworth Mountains, we characterize the surface microbiome of pristine Antarctic snow. Using presence/absence data, we observed a latitudinal change in microbial communities, notably with a decrease in alpha diversity at southern, more remote latitudes. Soil-related microorganisms dominated microbial assemblages, suggesting terrestrial inputs likely from aeolian transport. We identified indicator species within each location and, interestingly, northern sites harbored more endemic OTUs than southern samples, suggesting more variable and opportunistic communities in southern, more extreme systems. We also determined the impact of human presence on the snow microbiome by sampling the Lake Ellsworth deep field camp. While human presence has limited impact on the snow microbial communities across Antarctica, intense human activities, such as attempts to drill deep into the ice sheet, affect natural communities at specific locations. We recommend indigenous surface microbial communities are considered when forming plans for field activities that may affect their integrity.",

Identifying specific antibiotic resistant microbes is essential for quick and appropriate treatment. Increased antibiotic resistance in the environment may limit treatment options for infections. As the climate changes and permafrost thaws, antibiotic resistant microbes may multiply at an increased rate. Multidrug resistance genes are often found on plasmids, enabling the rapid sharing via horizontal gene transfer. Using culture-based methods, we found widespread antibiotic resistance along with heavy metal tolerance in local boreal forest soils affected by thawing permafrost. We sequenced our cultured bacteria using both Illumina and the Oxford Nanopore MinION to generate long-reads. We performed hybrid assemblies using both technologies. We identify individual resistance genes present in our samples. Importantly, these methods allow us to better understand the environmental reservoir of antibiotic resistance in Alaska.",

However, despite the research efforts, the molecular mechanism governing host-symbiont interaction in deep-sea mussels are still largely unknown. Here, using the model deep-sea mussel Bathymodiolus platiforns, we profiled the transcriptomic dynamic of the mussel gill during the loss and reacquisition of symbiont with RNA-seq technology. The analysis of DEGs (Differentially Expressed Genes) between untreated and symbiont loss samples revealed that the gill went through metabolic and cellular organizational changes mainly by promoting ribosomal activities and activating ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy. Meanwhile, the DE immune genes suggested that the host recognizes and interacts with endosymbiont through the pattern recognizing receptors, especially the Toll-like receptors. In addition, the DEGs between symbiont treated and environmental bacteria treated samples shed light on the mechanism of symbiont recognition and acquisition. The symbiont treatment not only partially reversed the transcriptomic changes caused by symbiont loss, but also suppressed host immune system which might facilitate the symbiont’s entrance and survival in the host bacteriocytes. All together, these results suggested that the host-symbiont system in B. platifrons is tightly regulated but also with plasticity to fit environmental fluctuations.",

Third, we will put in place a high quality analysis pipeline to validate and characterize the most promising leads at the genomic, phenotypic, and chemical level.

    "description": "The Cosmic Ray Exposure Sequencing Science (CRESS) payload system is a proof of concept experiment to assess the genomic impact of space radiation on seeds. CRESS was designed as a secondary payload for the December 2016 high-altitude, high-latitude, and long-duration balloon flight carrying the Boron And Carbon Cosmic Rays in the Upper Stratosphere (BACCUS) experimental hardware. Investigation of the biological effects of Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), particularly those of ions with High-Z and Energy (HZE), is of interest due to the genomic damage this type of radiation inflicts. The biological effects of upper-stratospheric mixed radiation above Antarctica (ANT) were sampled using Arabidopsis thaliana seeds and were compared to those resulting from a controlled simulation of GCR at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and to laboratory control seed. The payload developed for Antarctica exposure was broadly designed to 1U CubeSat specifications (10cmx10cmx10cm, ≤1.33kg), maintained 1 atm internal pressure, and carried an internal cargo of four seed trays (about 580,000 seeds) and twelve CR-39 Solid-State Nuclear Track Detectors (SSNTDs). The irradiated seeds were recovered, sterilized and grown on Petri plates for phenotypic screening. BNL and ANT M0 seeds showed significantly reduced germination rates and elevated somatic mutation rates when compared to non-irradiated controls, with the BNL mutation rate also being significantly higher than that of ANT. Genomic DNA from mutants of interest was evaluated with whole-genome sequencing using PacBio SMRT technology. Sequence data revealed the presence of an array of genome structural variants in the genomes of M0 and M1 mutant plants. Overall design: Arabidopsis thaliana seeds of the Columbia (Col-0) ecotype were placed into 24 x 24 bin seed trays (modified 1536-well plates) with bins which were then covered by polyolefin sealant film [USA Scientific] and flanked by CR-39 SSNTDs, for two non-concurrent exposures. In the BNL exposure, one seed tray with three CR-39 sheets on each side was placed in a modified T-25 flask for irradiation (H, 250 MeV, 10.62 Rad; He, 250 MeV, 3.165 Rad; O, 350 MeV, 1.08 Rad; Ti, 300 MeV, 0.735 Rad). The Antarctica exposure was 30 days in duration at an altitude of ~35 km. Four seed trays were arranged in a stack with three CR-39 plates at each end, and two sheets between each tray. After irradiation, seeds were returned to the University of Florida and stored at -20 °C until planting. Seeds were planted on Phytagel™-based nutrient media and grown for 14 days, at which time Petri plates were evaluated for germination and mutation rates. Mutants of interest were tracked, and preserved in liquid nitrogen if growth was deemed too impaired for the plant to mature. Whole genomic DNA was extracted from 10 mutants, which was used to prepare SMRT-Bell libraries (4 individual mutants, 1 pool of 6 mutants). The PacBio Sequel was used for Whole-Genome Sequencing of the samples, and the output sequences were processed to detect structural variants using the NGMLR and Sniffles softwares.",

    "description": "The McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica are the largest ice-free soil region on the continent. The region is a hyper-arid polar desert with extremely limited moisture availability. Microbial colonization dominates this ecosystem but surprisingly little is known about how communities respond to changing moisture regimes. We utilized the natural model system provided by transiently wetted soil at lake margins in the Dry Valleys to interrogate microbial responses along a well-defined contiguous moisture gradient and employed fine-scale taxonomic resolution to disentangle responses between and within phyla. We identified a striking non-linear response among bacteria and fungi where at low moisture levels small changes resulted in a large impact on diversity. Once communities reached asymptote at higher moisture levels changes were less pronounced. We demonstrate that whilst the main drivers were deterministic, a switch in the major influence occurred from abiotic factors at low moisture levels to biotic interactions at higher moisture.  Response between and within phyla was markedly different, highlighting the importance of fine-scale taxonomic resolution in community analysis. Furthermore we identify effects that appeared stochastic at broad taxonomic levels were in fact the result of deterministic factors when viewed at fine-scale resolution. Overall the findings provide critical new insight on the response to moisture and will allow better predictions of ecosystem resilience in the threatened McMurdo Dry Valleys system.",

The natural breakdown of wooden and metal-hulled shipwrecks over time is influenced by microorganisms. Microorganisms colonize a shipwreck immediately after the vessel comes to rest on the seafloor. Bacteria and archaea form communities on the surface of exposed materials such as wood or metal. As the communities grow and expand, a biofilm forms. This biofilm establishes conditions that allow for settlement of higher trophic levels which, in turn, attract larger, mobile fauna. This diverse community of micro- and macrofauna comprises a small ecosystem. In time, the shipwreck becomes an artificial reef. The nature of the biofilm community structure and function is not entirely understood. The goal of this study is to understand the changes to deep-sea biofilms caused by in situ exposure to residual spill contaminants through a comparative study involving historic shipwrecks within and external to the acute spill footprint.",

    "description": "Snow can be considered an independent ecosystem that hosts active microbial communities. Snow microbial assemblages have been extensively investigated in the Arctic and in the Antarctica, but rarely in mid-latitude mountain areas. In this study, we investigated the bacterial communities of snow collected in four glacierized areas (Alps, Eastern Anatolia, Karakoram and Himalaya) by high-throughput DNA sequencing. We also investigated the origin of the air masses that produced the sampled snowfalls by reconstructing back-trajectories. A standardized approach was applied to all the analyses in order to ease comparison among different communities and geographical areas. The bacterial communities hosted from 25 to 211 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), and their structure differed significantly between geographical areas. This suggests that snow bacterial communities may largely derive from ‘local’ air bacteria, maybe by deposition of airborne particulate of local origin that occurs during snowfall. However, some evidence suggest that a contribution of bacteria collected during air mass uplift to snow communities cannot be excluded, particularly when the air mass that originated the snow event is particularly rich in dust.",

    "description": "Recently deglaciated environments are ideal for studying the initial development of soils through the co-sucession of freshly exposed rock weathering and microbial ecosystems. Carbon (C), nitrogen (N) contents as well as pH and soil composition are thought to be dominant controls on soil microbial community structure development. However, the functional linkages between C and N contents, soil composition and microbial community structure remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the variations in geochemical properties and associated microbial structure along a transect in the proglacial area of a High-Arctic glacier (Longyearbreen, Svalbard). Our results reveal that C and N contents and isotopic compositions as well as weathering advancement and microbial abundance and community structure change in tandem along the transect. We found significant relationships between microbial and fungal community structures and total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) as well as Ca, Mg and Si. We suggest that the observed microbial and geochemical co-succession patterns of changes along our transect are primarily the result of the geomorphological heterogeneity of the progalcial terrain.",

We analyze the major physiological functional groups of genes affected by hydrogen peroxide exposure. In addition, we analyze which genes in our hydrogen peroxide-responsive set of genes belong to major known transcriptional regulatory circuits like iron homeostasis, anaerobiosis and others. We annotate which of the 293 hydrogen peroxide-responsive genes belong to operons. We annotate global transcriptional start sites and identify transcriptional start sites that are only present in hydrogen peroxide-treated bacteria. We validate the RNA-Seq data for a subset of representative genes by RT-qPCR and whether transcript abundance in this same subset of genes differs upon treatement with other reactive oxygen species encountered during infection, like organic peroxide, super oxide anion, and bleach. Overall design: Examination of transcriptional changes in sublethal 15 mM hydrogen peroxide-treated Neisseria gonorrhoeae in liquid culture compared to untreated controls Please note that the +TEX data was only used for visualization of peaks to determine transcription start sites (see the .wig files) and was not used in any way to quantify overall transcript abundances. Thus, the differential expression component of our analysis relied only on noTex samples and these are the only samples that were quantified (TPM) for.",

    "description": "Ultra-oligotrophic Lake Untersee is among the largest and deepest surface lakes of Central Queen Maud Land in East Antarctica. Dammed at its north end by the Anuchin Glacier, it is unsual with respect to other lakes of Antarctica, because the ice-cover dynamics of Lake Untersee are controlled by wind, with ablation—not melt—as the dominating physical process. Because of intense evaporation and sublimation, summer melt does not provide significant amounts of water for recharge, the primary source of water for the lake being subsurface melt from the Aunchin Glacier.There have been a number of studies describing the structure and function of the microbial communities within the water column and benthic environments of Lake Untersee, however thus far there have been no studies that examine the linkages between the lake ecosystem with that of the surrounding soils or the Anuchin Glacier. The Anuchin Glacier, the primary source of water for Lake Untersee may also play an important role as a major contributor of nutrients and biota into the lake ecosystem.Based on microbial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we show the dominating bacterial signatures in Lake Untersee Oasis are affiliated with Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Aerosol and local soil depositions on the glacier surface result in distinct microbial communities developing in glacier ice and cryoconite holes. Our studies indicate that up to 36% of cryoconite microbial assemblages are also present in Lake Untersee and these cryoconite communities may be a potential source of organisms for the benthic microbial mats in the lake. However, major biotic sources for the lake ecosystem are still unknown, illustrating the possible importance of englacial and subglacial zones.The Anuchin Glacier may be considered as a vector for the bacterial colonization of the perennially ice-covered Lake Untersee and hence shapes the pelagic and benthic ecosystems. Global warming as a result of increasing levels of anthropogenic greenhouse gases may lead to changes of environmental conditions in many habitats resulting in shifts of within the structure and function of microbial communities. These potential impacts require a thorough understanding of the linkages between various dynamic processes such as those observed within the Lake Untersee Oasis.",

    "description": "Climatic warming may stimulate microbial decomposition of the Arctic’s vast pool of thermally protected soil carbon, resulting in globally significant greenhouse-gas emissions. Although significant temperature increases are anticipated for Arctic soil profiles, our current understanding of the controls on bacterial community composition in permafrost-affected soils is restricted to the uppermost surface layer. Here we investigate the relative influence of soil depth and seasonality on bacterial community composition in 166 soil profile samples collected from the surface down into the underlying permafrost at multiple times from late-winter to fall in a mesic Low Arctic tundra site. Bacterial community composition and phylogenetic diversity varied greatly with soil depth, and much less among sampling times, with patterns in community assembly best explained by pH. An OTU correlation analysis indicated that the surface organic and subsoil mineral soils contained almost completely separate interaction networks. Acidobacteria dominated surface communities but declined significantly with soil depth and increasing pH, whereas Bacteroidetes abundance increased with pH. We conclude that tundra soil bacterial community composition is more strongly influenced by soil depth rather than season and that soil pH influences microbial community composition, not just horizontally across the uppermost surface layers, but also down through Arctic soil profiles.",

    "description": "Cryoconite holes, i.e. small ponds that form on glacier surface, are considered the most biologically active environments on glaciers. Ecology of cryoconite holes in polar regions has been widely investigated, while that of cryoconite holes on mountain glaciers has been neglected. In this study we investigated the temporal dynamics of the microbial communities in cryoconite holes on the Forni Glacier (Italian Alps) along the ablation season and the contribution of eolian transport from periglacial environments to the microbial communities of cryoconite holes. We used Next-Generation Sequencing to assess the structure of bacterial communities, and estimated also photosynthesis and respiration rates of cryoconite holes with field measurements. We found a seasonal succession of bacterial communities, with autotrophic populations dominating communities after snow melting, and heterotrophic populations increasing in abundance later in the season. However, communities in cryoconite holes were mainly heterotrophic. Surprisingly, we also observed similarity between communities in cryoconite holes within few tens of meters to one another. Conversely, none of the periglacial environments we investigated (moraines, proglacial plain, and the debris of probable endoglacial origin) hosted bacterial communities similar to those found in the cryoconite holes in any season. Hence, periglacial environments seem not to be the source of bacteria living in the cryoconite, but may provide inputs of organic matter to cryoconite necessary to sustain the heterotrophic communities of cryoconite holes even without affecting the structure of their microbial communities.",

The MicroPolar project focuses on marine microbial food webs and biogeochemical cycles in the Arctic Ocean and will provide a better description and understanding of the organisms, the processes, and the feedback mechanisms that shape this interaction.The most critical R&D challenges posed by environmental change in the Arctic Ocean concerns the role of microorganisms; “Who are they?”, “What are they doing?”, “How do they interact?” and How do they respond to the current climate change?”. A project approaching these questions calls for interdisciplinary collaboration. State of the art analytical techniques and metagenomics will be used to describe the microbial community and to quantify carbon flow in Arctic microbial food webs during a full annual cycle. Sensitivity experiments with biogeochemical process studies in mesocosms will be used to inform on the key importance of biogeochemical feedbacks to climate change and rising CO2. The project partners cover a range of disciplines including microbial ecology, climate research, biogeochemistry, metagenomics and ocean modeling, which all are required to conduct the research and to integrate the results in an Earth system science and environmental management perspective.

    "description": "Characterization of the microorganisms on skin is essential for understanding how a host evolves in association with its microbial symbionts, modeling immune system development, diagnosing illnesses, and exploring the origins and etiology of disease. Although many studies have characterized the human microbiome, far less is known about the skin microbiome of non-human mammals. The objective of this research was to create a baseline skin microbiome dataset for the Mammalia class, testing the effects of species, location, hygiene, body region, and biological sex. The back, torso, and inner thigh regions of 187 non-human mammals and 20 human participants were collected to include representatives from 38 species and 10 mammalian orders. Animals were collected from local farms, zoos, households, and the wild. All samples were amplified using the V3-V4 16S rRNA gene region and sequenced using a MiSeq (Illumina). Human skin was significantly less diverse than all other mammalian orders according to Shannon indices (6.54 versus 3.96, p < 0.001). The factor most strongly associated with community variation for all samples was whether the host was a human (PERMANOVA, F = 37.8, p < 0.001; Figure 2). By analyzing all samples together, random forest modelling identified that human and animal samples could be distinguished correctly 98.51.2% of the time. This study represents the largest mammalian skin microbiome project to date and is the first study to elucidate the skin microbiota for 32 distinct species. Additionally, these findings are the first to demonstrate that human skin is distinct, not only distinct from other Primates, but from all 10 mammalian orders sampled. Baseline data on the mammalian skin microbiome is crucial to make informed decisions for veterinarian research and conservation strategies, as well as providing implications for mammalian evolutionary history.",

    "description": "Arctic heathlands represent a major carbon store and key component of the global carbon cycle. Arctic warming and the vulnerability of soil carbon to microbial decomposition could amplify the effects of climate change. The sensitivity of plot-scale experiments simulating climate change effects on soil microbial communities may be compromised by influences of spatial and seasonal controls, and experimental approaches studying plot scale interactions have been limited. We investigated the variation in Arctic heathland soil bacterial communities at two survey sites in Sweden between spring and summer 2013, at scales of 0-1m, 1-100m and between sites (>100m) using 16S rRNA gene T-RFLP and amplicon sequencing. Amplicon sequencing supported the evidence of seasonal shifts, from r- to K-selected taxon dominated communities influencing in silico predictions of functional potential. Network analyses revealed seasonal keystone taxa, with a spring betaproteobacterial sub44 network centred upon a Burkholderia OTU and a reconfiguration to a summer sub-network centred upon an alphaproteobacterial OTU. The importance of two season-specific keystone taxa suggests that the general stability of Arctic heathland soil bacterial communities could be disproportionally influenced by seasonal perturbations affecting individual taxa.",

In this study, we investigated the microbial diversity in the surface snow surrounding the Concordia Research Station on the High Antarctic Plateau through a polyphasic approach, including direct prokaryotic quantification by flow cytometry and catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH), and phylogenetic identification by 16s RNA gene clone library Sanger sequencing and 454 16S amplicon pyrosequencing. The microbial community was largely composed of Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The presence of both photo- and chemo-autotrophs, possibly organized in thin biofilm-like structures, suggested moderate microbiological activity. Thus, microorganisms could not only be considered as deposited airborne particles, but as an active part of the snowpack ecology of the High Antarctic Plateau.",

Fluid is discharged at 103-104 liters per second at 10-20°C and diffuses through sediment on the outcrop, impacting temperature and geochemistry. The microbial communities on and around an active venting site of this nature have never been studied. This proposal will address this gap by surveying the microbial diversity along a sediment depth transect across the outcrop. In December 2014 cruise AT26-24 collected sediment samples from this outcrop, and DNA was extracted. 16S sequencing from 11 cores on the outcrop and one core taken near the outcrop will provide the first data about community diversity, dominant taxa, and changes in potential community function under various physiochemical conditions.PI, Laura Zinke",

    "description": "Endophytic bacteria have been the center of attention in recent years due to the potential benefits they provide to the plants that they associated with, for example, nitrogen fixation,  nutrient mobilization, etc. However, the factors determining the assembly of the endophytic bacterial communities inside the plants and their functions are not yet well understood, especially about the plant microbiomes in cold climate. The goal of this study is to answer if the endophytic bacterial communities in arctic plant species; Oxyria digyna show tissue-specificity.In 2013, the micropropagated bait plants grown with minimal bacterial load were planted in the study site in Kilpisjärvi, Finland (69oN) in July 2013, then were harvested in August 2013 and in July 2014, together with wild O. digyna growing adjacent to the plots. The total endophytic bacterial communities from leaves and roots were analyzed by 16s rRNA gene-targeted PCR and next generation sequencing on ion-torrent platform. The data clearly shows that the endophytic communities from different tissues differed significantly in species richness and community diversity, as well as in the community structure. The root bacterial communities were more diverse than the leaves. The community composition from leaf and root was also significantly different from each other, and different bacterial taxa dominated the communities in different tissues.  This divergence was mainly due to the differential distribution of share taxa, but we also identified 76 and 18 OTUs which were root- and leaf- specific, present only in root and leaf samples, respectively. A clear succession in endophytic root communities of micropropagated bait plants in the field was also detected, indicating the acquisition of specific community members from the rhizosphere soil. In contrast, the leaf communities of bait plants resembled closely to those of wild plants at all times which could be explained by the aerial acquisition, suggesting that leaf and root communities are partially of different origin.",

Here, we assessed the effects of a long-term contamination of Hg in soils on the bacterial and fungal communities along a gradient of contamination from no to high contamination. Short-term reactions (30 days) of the microbial communities in these soils having different levels of historic Hg contamination were further evaluated in microcosm experiments where soils were either spiked with dissolved HgCl2 or not. Results show a strong impact of a long-term Hg contamination on both bacterial and fungal community structures, diversities and activities (basal respiration and growth rates). In contrast, no short-term effects of Hg was observed on the microbial community structures and activities. Indicator species analysis showed that taxa from the Chthoniobacteraceae (bacteria), Leptodontidium sp. (fungi) and Trichosporon sp. (fungi) were strongly associated with high Hg contaminated soils, implying they possess capabilities to tolerate Hg in soils.",

This is the first description of the prokaryotic and unicellular eukaryotic community diversity from benthic under-ice microbial mats from a perennially ice-covered High-Arctic lake, Ward Hunt Island, Canada. Given the different environmental conditions in the benthic under-ice and the littoral zones, we wanted to verify how different the microbial communities would be in those two regions of the lake. Microbial mats were sampled from two depths in the benthic zone and from one littoral site to also assess any depth diffference in the microbial community. The under-ice sites have lower light availability and are more stable environments than the littoral sites. Consequently, we hypothesized that the microbial communities from the two zones would be taxonomically distinct and to test this hypothesis, we sequenced the 16S and 18S ribosomal rRNA and rRNA genes from triplicate microbial mat samples from these sites. Sequencing was performed via MiSeq Illumina technology. High Arctic aquatic ecosystems are facing unprecedented changes as a result of ongoing global warming. Projected scenarios include changes in snow cover that is a central feature of northern landscapes, but with unknown implications in terms of ecosystem connectivity and functioning. In this study, we characterized the diversity and composition of microbial communities (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota) in distinct interconnected habitats that are part of the same watershed. The different habitats (snow, watertrack, lake, stream, inshore ocean) were sampled along a hydrologic continuum at Ward Hunt Island (latitude 83° North) in the Canadian High Arctic. We investigated the microbial connectivity along a longitudinal gradient within Ward Hunt lake watershed on two distinct levels : on the community and population levels. To achieve this, we explored the diversity and composition of potentially active microbial communities using Illumina sequencing of the 16S (Bacteria and Archaea) and 18S (Eukarya) rRNA along the water continuum from snowbanks to inshore ocean. Specifically, we tested the following hypotheses: First, snow hosts a diverse microbiota and secondly, snow is a source of microbial diversity for downstream communities, connected via water flow.",

On the basis of total community DNA, we here studied the nitrogen-fixing communities at two arcto-alpine pioneer plant species, Oxyria digyna and Saxifraga oppositifolia, using the nifH gene as a proxy. Replicate samples taken from two arctic regions, Kilpisjärvi and Ny-Ålesund, next to one alpine region, Mayrhofen, were included, to study a South-to-North cold-climate soil gradient.  The data revealed strong regional effects on the dominating nitrogen fixers. As a major overall finding, anaerobic bacterial taxa dominated the diazotrophic bacterial communities of the two plant species. Specifically, Geobacter and Leptothrix spp. dominated the Mayrhofen and Kilpisjärvi regions, while members of the Clostridiales preferred the Kilpisjärvi and Ny-Ålesund regions. Endosphere communities were enriched with Goebacter and Clostridia, whereas the soil communities were dominated with Burkholderia and Leptothrix.",

Little is known about the role of soil developmental stage in shaping rhizosphere microbiome in deglaciated moraine. We studied a soil chronosequence in the forefront of a receding glacier (Midtre Lovénbreen, Svalbard Island) encompassing 7 sites differentially exposed to primary succession, not isolated by distance but by the age of ecosystem evolution. Focusing on the rhizosphere of the ubiquitous plant Saxifraga oppositifolia, we assessed the diversity of bacterial communities subjected to different environmental factors across the chronosequence. By applying high-throughput sequencing, Phylochip and DNA-based fingerprinting we demonstrated that soil development was the factor shaping bacterial community in the earlier successional stage, while the rhizosphere effect was significant in soils released by the glacier since more than 20 years. Rhizosphere bacterial communities were highly similar after 20 and 100 years of soil development, differentiating at the older successional stages in the mature tundra ecosystem. We demonstrated the presence of bacterial distribution patterns influenced, besides the interaction with the plant, by environmental factors related to pedogenesis and ecosystem evolution stage.",

Here, we investigated the diversity of plant root associated fungal communities from two pioneer arcto-alpine plants, Oxyria digyna and Saxifraga oppositifolia, from three distinct geographic regions. DNA was extracted from bulk and rhizosphere soils and from the plant roots, after which the ITS2 region was amplified and amplicons were sequenced in order to profile the fungal communities. Diversities as well as community structures of the fungal communities were primarily impacted by the factor compartment (bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, endosphere). The highest diversities were detected in the rhizosphere soils followed by bulk soils and endosphere samples. Endosphere fungal communities exhibited community structures that were clearly distinct from those of rhizosphere or bulk soil. We detected no impact of geographic region on the diversity values of the soil fungal communities. However, remarkably, the diversities of the endosphere communities of both plant species decreased with increasing latitude. Rhizosphere and endosphere fungal community structures were influenced by geographic region, with low host plant specificity. Soil pH clearly determined the community structures of the bulk soil fungal communities. The fungal genera Mycenella, Cadophora and Varicosporium dominated the endosphere, whereas Geomyces pannorum was predominantly present in the soils.",

Age was a major modulator of the microbial community of the thaw ponds. Surprisingly, typical freshwater taxa comprised only a small fraction of the community, while thaw ponds of all age classes were dominated by enigmatic bacterial and fungal phyla.

Microbial eukaryotes in these lakes occupy a variety of trophic levels within the simple aquatic food web ranging from primary producers to tertiary predators. Here, we report the first molecular study to describe the vertical distribution of the eukaryotic community residing in the photic zone of the east lobe (ELB) and west lobe (WLB) of the chemically stratified Lake Bonney. The 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) libraries revealed vertically stratified populations dominated by photosynthetic protists, with a cryptophyte dominating shallow populations (ELB-6m; WLB-10m), a haptophyte occupying mid-depths (both lobes 13m) and chlorophytes residing in the deepest layers (ELB-18 and 20m; WLB-15 and 20m) of the photic zone. A previously undetected stramenopile occurred throughout the water column of both lobes. Temporal variation in the eukaryotic populations was examined during the transition from Antarctic summer (24-h sunlight) to polar night (complete dark). Protist diversity was similar between the two lobes of Lake Bonney due to exchange between the photic zones of the two basins via a narrow bedrock sill. However, vertical and temporal variation in protist distribution occurred, indicating the influence of the unique water chemistry on the biology of the two dry valley watersheds.",

Differences in the structure of bacterial communities have been documented among Arctic and mountain glaciers, and among glaciers in different areas of the world. In this study we investigate the structure of bacterial communities of cryoconite holes of Baltoro Glacier, a large (62 km in length and 524 km2 of surface) glacier of the Karakoram, by high throughput sequencing of the V5-V6 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. We found that Betaproteobacteria, dominated bacterial communities, with large abundance of genera Polaromonas, probably thanks to the highly versatile metabolism of this genus, and Limnohabitans, which may have been favoured by the presence of supraglacial lakes in the area where we sampled cryoconites. In addition, cryoconites that occurred in separate areas on the surface of the glacier hosted different bacterial communities, while no spatial pattern of variation in community structure was observed within each area. This probably occurred because of variation in environmental conditions, mainly pH, of cryoconite holes in different areas of the glacier surface.",

    "description": "Bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems help bacteria to reduce their metabolism in various stressful conditions and also play a part in generating antibiotic tolerant bacterial subpopulation called persisters. Many toxins of the bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems are ribonucleases. Such toxins have been mostly viewed as degraders of mRNA, however recently it was demonstrated that they are also capable of cleaving non-coding RNA. Current libraries are a part of a project which aims to identify the major RNA cleavage sites (in mRNA, rRNA and regulatory non-coding RNA) of MazF and MqsR toxins in E. coli. We were also interested in the activity of promoters during toxin overexpression. We used a targeted RNA-sequencing approach that allowed us to map the distinct 5- and 3-ends of toxin-cleaved RNA and also the beginnings of transcripts. We extracted total RNA from cultures where the expression of MazF or MqsR was induced; RNA from log phase culture was used as the control. In addition, RNA extracted from stationary phase culture was used to test for the possible toxin cleavage in natural stress conditions. The cleaved RNA is rapidly recycled making it possible that we miss important cleavage sites due to RNA degradation during the prolonged stationary phase. Therefore, in addition to wt E. coli we also used stationary phase RNA from exoribonuclease deficient strain where RNA cleavage products accumulate.   Identification of the 5 ends is based on ligation of RNA adapters to the cellular RNA molecules, which requires 5 -monophosphates. Mapping of the 3 -ends is based on poly(A) tailing of RNA, which requires 3 -OH groups. Transcription initiation, ordinary cellular RNases, and toxin endonucleases all produce different types of RNA ends. These can be enzymatically converted to 5 -phosphates and 3 -OHs, which allows one to separately quantify the RNA ends produced by each of these processes from a single biological sample. Briefly, (i) primary transcripts have 5 -triphosphate ends that can be converted to monophosphate by Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (TAP), and 3 -hydroxyl ends that can be directly polyadenylated by poly(A) polymerase. (ii) Most cellular RNases (excluding RNase I and the toxins) produce 5 -monophosphates and 3 -hydroxyls, which are directly usable for ligation/polyadenylation. (iii) RNase I, MazF, and several other toxins produce 5 -hydroxyl ends that need to be phosphorylated by T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK) prior to ligation, and 2,3 -cyclic phosphates that need to be dephosphorylated and converted to 3 -hydroxyls, also by T4 PNK. In short, for each of our RNA samples three 5 end and two 3 end libraries were made. The PNK treated libraries contain reads mapping specifically to 5- or 3-ends left by toxin (or RNaseI) cleavage and TAP treated libraries have extra reads mapping to beginnings of the transcripts.",

    "description": "Microbial communities harbor immense genetic diversity with enormous promise for applications in bioproduct synthesis and green chemistry. Metagenomic libraries provide a window into this largely untapped reservoir of nucleic acid diversity and individual libraries have been generated from a variety of terrestrial and aquatic environments. A limitation is that metagenomic libraries are typically project-specific and maintained in isolation. In an effort to enable the sharing of genetic material from environmental samples for the benefit of the scientific community, we are establishing the Canadian MetaMicroBiome Library. This repository will house composite soil samples that are characterized by extensive 16S rRNA gene and whole-genome sequencing, generating taxonomic profiles and metabolic pathway reconstructions for each sample. The sequence data will be submitted to existing public databases and linked with detailed physical, chemical and geographic characterization of the samples according to established metagenomic standards. Sample DNA will be used to construct high quality libraries in cosmid vectors, allowing for phenotypic screening in a broad range of microbial surrogate hosts. Phenotypic screening of metagenomic libraries provides access to truly novel functions that would otherwise be missed by sequence-based surveys of bulk community DNA or metagenomic libraries. MetaMicroBiome is being initiated with soil samples collected from across Canada, and initial libraries are being screened for novel glycoside hydrolase activities in multiple surrogate hosts. Once MetaMicroBiome is established, contributions of samples from other environments will be accepted for inclusion. The resulting resource will provide the international scientific community with access to a common collection of thoroughly characterized community-contributed genetic material in clone library format for custom phenotypic screens.",

    "description": "Evidence for the pivotal role of plant-associated bacteria to plant health and productivity has accumulated rapidly in the last years. However, several key questions remain unanswered, among which is the impact of climate zones on the plant-associated microbiota. Importantly, plant-bacterial interactions in wild plants and in arcto-alpine biomes have not been well studied as compared to those in tropical and temperate biomes. We hypothesized that the bacterial communities associated with pioneer plants in the former regions have major roles in plant health support, and this would be reflected in the formation of climate and host plant specific endophytic communities. We also hypothesized that these endophytes would have a tight association with their respective host plants. To examine the drivers of the plant-associated bacterial communities, we compared the latter in the perennial plants Oxyria digyna and Saxifraga oppositifolia - naturally growing in three arcto-alpine regions [Mayrhofen, Austria - alpine, Kilpisjärvi, Finland - low Arctic and Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard -highArctic] - with those in the corresponding bulk soils. As expected, the bulk soil bacterial communities in the three regions were significantly different. The relative abundances of Proteobacteria decreased progressively from the alpine to the high-arctic soils, whereas those of Actinobacteria increased. The candidate division AD3 and Acidobacteria abounded in the low Arctic. With respect to the endophytic bacterial communities, plant species and geographic region were the major determinants of the community structures. The plants in the alpine region had higher relative abundances of Proteobacteria, as compared to the plants from the low- and high-arctic regions which were dominated by Firmicutes. A highly conserved shared set of omnipresent bacterial taxa was found to occur in the two plant species, here denoted as the ‘tight’ core bacteriome. Burkholderiales, Actinomycetales and Rhizobiales were common members of this core, and these taxa were the main contributors to the differences in the endophytic bacterial community structures across compartments as well as regions. We postulate that this tight core is due to selection by the two plants, concomitant with a highly efficient adaptation of such “core bacteriome” to the plant-associated habitats.",

Each site was sampled in triplicate and samples were divided and preserved for extraction using our standard protocol (three replicates), and for extraction using the EMP protocol (three replicates). Half of the samples are from the epilimnion and hypolimnion of ultra-oligotrophic Toolik Lake collected over the course of the summer, and the rest are from different environments associated with a headwater stream that lies upslope of Toolik Lake.

Here, we present an example of how microbial contamination from active layer soil disrupted analysis of the potentially active microbial community in permafrost soil. We also present the development and use of two tracers: 1) fluorescent plastic microspheres and 2) Pseudomonas putida genetically tagged with Green Fluorescent Protein production to mimic potential microbial contamination of two permafrost cores. A protocol with special emphasis on avoiding microbial contamination was developed and employed to examine how far microbial contamination can penetrate into permafrost cores. The quantity of tracer elements decreased with depth into the permafrost cores, but the tracers were detected as far as 17 mm from the surface of the cores. The results emphasize that caution should be taken to limit microbial contamination during permafrost coring and subsequent sampling handling.",

Here we have for the first time evaluated the role of these algae in association with the full microbial community composition (i.e., algae, bacteria, archaea) in distinct surface habitats and on twelve glaciers and permanent snow fields in Svalbard and Arctic Sweden. We cross-correlated these data with the analyses of specific metabolites such as fatty acids and pigments, and a full suite of potential critical physico-chemical parameters including major and minor nutrients, and trace metals. We show that correlations between single algal species, metabolites, and specific geochemical parameters can be used to unravel mixed metabolic signals in complex communities, further assign them to single species and infer their functionality. The data also clearly show that the production of metabolites in snow and ice algae is driven mainly by nitrogen and less so by phosphorus limitation. This is especially important for the synthesis of secondary carotenoids, which cause a darkening of glacial surfaces leading to a decrease in surface albedo and eventually higher melting rates.",

    "description": "Around 1700 Gt carbon are stored in the Northern latitude permafrost regions (Schuur et al, BioScience 2008). This is more than double the size of the atmospheric carbon pool but the estimates are still quite uncertain and might be even higher. It is however estimated that 25 percent of this large carbon pool in Arctic soils will be lost by the end of the 21st century and will be released to the atmosphere as CO2 (Gruber et al., 2004). The subduction of organic-rich material from the surface to deeper layers caused by repeated freezing and thawing of the active layer during Arctic summer is assumed to be a major mechanism of carbon storage in the Arctic. These cryoturbations are spatially widely distributed and store high amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC). Decomposition of recent cryoturbated carbon is strongly retarded thereby essentially taking out this fraction of SOC from the current carbon cycle. Todays primary concern and research focus is the vulnerability of cryoturbated SOC due to global warming which is predicted to lead to intensified decomposition and elevated greenhouse gas emissions. Here we present a study that aims to provide a comprehensive picture of the microbial community structure of permafrost-affected and cryoturbated soils of different Northern latitude permafrost regions in Siberia and Greenland. For this purpose, soil samples were collected in northeast Siberia in a transect along the upper Kolyma river, and in the Zackenberg region, Greenland. The sampling scheme covered several bioclimatic subzones and vegetation types. We are currently analysing data retrieved from SSU amplicon sequencing, the quantification of several functional groups involved in carbon cycling and physico-chemical analyses in order to predict potential microbial regulators in SOC storage. This study is part of the multinational CryoCARB project (for further information, see: www.cryocarb.net).",

    "description": "Microbial life in the nutrient-limited aThe vast frozen terrain of northern latitude ecosystems is typically thought of as being nearly biologically inert for the winter period. Yet deep within the frozen ground of northern latitude soils reside microbial communities that can remain active during the winter months. As we have shown previously, microbial communities may remain active in permafrost soils just below the freezing point of water. Though perhaps more importantly, microbial communities persist in unfrozen areas of water, soil, and sediment beneath water bodies the entire year. Microbial activity in taliks may have significant impacts on biogeochemical cycling in northern latitude ecosystems because their activity is not limited by the winter months. Here we present compositional and functional data, including long term incubation data, for microbial communities within permafrost landscapes, in permafrost and taliks, and the implications of these activities on permafrost carbon decomposition and the flux of CO2 and CH4. Our experiment was conducted at the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX) within the Bonanza Creek LTER in interior Alaska. Our site consists of a black spruce forest on permafrost that has degraded into thermokarst bogs at various times over the last five hundred years. We assume the parent substrate of the deep (1-1.5m) thermokarst peat was similar to the nearby forest soil and permafrost C before thaw. At this site, flux tower and autochamber data show that the thermokarst bog is a sink of CO2 , but a significant source of CH4. Yet this does not tell the whole story as these data do not fully capture microbial activity within the deep unfrozen talik layer. There is published evidence that within thermokarst bogs, relatively rapid decomposition of old forest floor material may be occurring. There are several possible mechanisms for this pattern; one possible mechanism for accelerated decomposition is the overwintering activities of microbial communities in taliks of thermokarst soils. To test this idea, we conducted anaerobic incubations of deep (1m) bog soils at two different temperatures to determine microbial temperature response functions. We also measured soil profile CO2 and CH4 concentrations and functional gene assays of the deep bog microbial community. Incubation data in combination with overwinter temperature profiles show that the talik has high potential rates of CO2 and CH4 production compared to the mass of C from forest floor and permafrost C to 1m depth. Results highlight the potential importance of taliks affecting the vulnerability of permafrost carbon to decomposition and reduction to methane.nd low-permeability continental crystalline crust is abundant but remains relatively unexplored. Using high-throughput sequencing to assess the 16S rRNA gene diversity, we found diverse bacterial and archaeal communities along a 2516-m-deep drill hole in continental crystalline crust in Outokumpu, Finland.",

    "description": "The two DOE missions that can be linked to the analysis of the genomes in this proposal are (i) biogeochemistry, via the contribution of roseobacters to the global climate, and (ii) phylogenetic diversity, via the systematic analysis of this not yet genomically characterized but highly diverse monophyletic subgroup of the Roseobacter clade, which is one of the main targets of current marine microbiology. Roseobacters can account for as much as 25% of the bacterial community in surface waters and have a global distribution. They have been shown to be very important in the global carbon and sulfur cycles. Members of the Roseobacter clade can oxidize carbon monoxide, an important greenhouse gas formed in seawater when sunlight oxidizes marine dissolved organic matter. In addition, roseobacters including Phaeobacter spp. are known to degrade dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) to dimethylsulfide (DMS), which is volatile, and/or converted by demethylation to mercaptopropionate. DMSP is produced by dinoflagellates and prymnesiophytes. Since DMS is involved in cloud nucleation it is evident that the activity of these bacteria directly affects the global climate.",

Recent studies have revealed that structures of those below-ground plant-fungus networks differ between arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal symbioses. Nonetheless, we still remain ignorant of how ericaceous plant species, which dominate arctic and alpine tundra, constitute networks with their root-associated fungi. Based on a high-throughput DNA sequencing dataset, we characterized the statistical properties of a network involving 16 ericaceous plant species and more than 500 fungal taxa in the alpine-subalpine region of on Mt. Tateyama, central Japan. While all the 16 ericaceous species were associated mainly with fungi in the order Helotiales, they varied remarkably in associations with fungi in other orders such as Sebacinales, Atheliales, Agaricales, Russulales, and Thelephorales. The ericaceous plant-fungus network was characterized by high symbiont or host preferences. Moreover, the network had a characteristic structure called \"anti-nestedness\", which has been previously reported in ectomycorrhizal plant-fungus networks. The results lead to the hypothesis that ericaceous plants in cold environments can host unexpectedly diverse root-associated fungal taxa, constituting networks whose structures are similar to previously reported ectomycorrhizal networks but not to arbuscular mycorrhizal ones.",

    "description": "Information on recent photosynthetic biomass distribution and biogeography of Arctic marine pico-eukaryotes (0.2 – 3 µm) are needed to better understand consequences of environmental change for Arctic marine ecosystems. We analysed pico-eukaryote biomass and community composition in Fram Strait and larger parts of the central Arctic Ocean (Nansen Basin, Amundsen Basin) by chlorophyll a (Chl a) measurements, Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA), and 454-pyrosequencing. Samples were collected during summer 2012, the year with the latest record sea ice minimum. Chl a values were highest in eastern Fram Strait and pico-plankton accounted for 60-90% of Chl a biomass during the observation period. ARISA-patterns and 454-pyrosequencing revealed, that pico-eukaryote distribution is closely related to water mass distribution in the euphotic zone of the Arctic Ocean. Phaeocystaceae, Micromonas sp., Dinophyceae and Syndinales constitute a high proportion of sequence reads, while sequence abundance of autotrophic Phaeocystaceae and mixotrophic Micromonas sp. was inversely correlated. Highest sequence abundances of Phaeocystaceae were observed in the warm Atlantic waters in Fram Strait, while Micromonas sp. dominated the abundant biosphere in the arctic halocline. Our results are from particular interest, because there are hypotheses that environmental conditions in Nansen Basin might become more similar to the current conditions in Fram Strait. In regard to this we propose that in response biodiversity and biomass of pico-eukaryotes in Nansen Basin could resemble those currently observed in the Fram Strait in the future. This would significantly alter biogeochemical cycles in that area, that constitutes a large part of the central Arctic Ocean.",

The assembly of these communities is affected by aeolian deposition. However, the abundance, diversity, sources, and activity of airborne microorganisms in the Arctic are poorly understood. We studied bacteria in the atmosphere over southwest Greenland and found that the diversity of bacterial communities correlated positively with air temperature and negatively with relative humidity. The communities consisted of 1.3*103±1.0*103 cells m-3, which were aerosolized from local terrestrial environments or transported from marine, glaciated, and terrestrial surfaces over long distances. On average, airborne bacterial cells displayed a high activity potential, reflected in the high 16S rRNA copy number (590±300 rRNA cell-1), that correlated positively with water vapour pressure. We observed that bacterial clades differed in their activity potential. For instance, a high activity potential was seen for Rubrobacteridae and Clostridiales while a low activity potential was observed for Proteobacteria. Of those bacterial families that harbour ice-nucleation active species, which are known to facilitate freezing and may thus be involved in cloud and rain formation, cells with a high activity potential were rare in air, but were enriched in rain.",

    "description": "Microbial communities and soil carbon (C) have been shown to vary in response to increasing vegetation cover during soil development after deglaciation. However, little is known about the ability of microorganisms to utilize various C sources in glacier forefield soils. We supplied ecologically relevant 13C-labelled C sources (Chlorella, Penicillium and Festuca) to three distinct environments (supraglacial sediments, barren soils and vegetated soils) of the Damma glacier area to monitor 13CO2 production. We identified prokaryotic and fungal populations able to utilize these sources by using DNA-stable isotope probing coupled with Illumina MiSeq sequencing of ribosomal markers. A high initial 13CO2 pulse indicated that 13C-labelled microbial and plant material were consumed. The 13C-enriched DNA results indicated that betaproteobacterial taxa affiliated to the families Oxalobacteraceae and Comamonadaceae were important players in C utilization from different sources and present in all environments. In contrast, different fungal taxa played different roles in C degradation depending on the soil environment. Overall, our findings reveal that C utilization  is driven by similar prokaryotic populations along a glacier forefield, while the distribution of active fungal populations are more influenced by environmental factors.",

    "description": "The role that neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria play in the Arctic tundra is unknown. This study surveyed chemosynthetic iron-oxidizing microbial mat communities on the North Slope of Alaska, near Toolik Field Station (TFS) at Toolik Lake (68.63N-149.60W). Microbial iron mats were common in submerged habitats with stationary or slowly flowing water, and had their greatest areal extent coating plant stems and sediments in wet sedge meadows. The known mor-photypes of Fe-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) dominated all the mats. Cool water temperatures (9–11°C), reduced pH (pH 5.0 – 6.6), and the shallow water table constrained by underlaying per-mafrost likely contributed to an active iron cycle. A microbial survey of five sites based on 16S rRNA genes found a predominance of Proteobacteria, with Betaproteobacteria and members of the Comamondaceae being the most prevalent operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Clades of known lithotrophic FeOB composed 5-10% of the communities. Somewhat surprisingly OTUs related to cyanobacteria and chloroplasts accounted 3–25% of the communities. High resolution oxygen profiles showed evidence for oxygenic photosynthesis in the surface layer of some mats, indicating co-existence of photosynthetic and FeOB populations. Iron mats incubated anaerobi-cally with 10 mM acetate rapidly initiated Fe-reduction, and OTUs related to the Geobacterace-ae, were relatively abundant at all sites, indicating that iron mats are zones of active iron cycling.

    "description": "Glacial ice surfaces comprise a seasonally-evolving three-dimensional photic zone which accumulates microbial biomass within the weathering crust, driving positive feedbacks in ice melt and modulating the flow of carbon to carbon-limited downstream ecosystems. Viruses appear influential on glacier bacterial communities; therefore we examined viral interactions with the bacterial communities eluted from the weathering crust of a Svalbard glacier. Estimation of viral decay rates that a strong viral control of bacterial productivity is mediated by a physically robust viral population. Amending microcosms with carbon and nutrients permitted the bacterial community to escape viral control, as evidenced by a decline in virus-to-bacterium ratio concomitant with increased cell numbers and productivity. Both the source bacterial community and microcosms were dominated by a few taxa, principally Janthinobacterium, seemingly challenging the “kill the winner” paradigm. We propose that a delicate interplay of bacterial and viral strategies affects biogeochemical cycling upon glaciers and, ultimately, downstream ecosystems.",

Here, the expedition members of the Trans-Antarctic Winter Traverse, a terrestrial analogous expedition to space travel, gave stool and saliva samples for each of the eight months of travel, in addition to a preliminary baseline sample. For saliva, significant (P < 0.001) differences were seen between Baseline salivary bacterial load and all other time points, but not between participants. Bacterial diversity was significantly (P = 0.002) lower in Baseline samples than all other sampling months, though individual differences were also significant (P = 0.016). At the taxonomic level of classification, significant time point differences in the Bacteroidetes (P = 0.008) phylum, and the Desulfotomaculum (P = 0.013), Veillonella (P = 0.016), Prevotella (P = 0.022), Megasphaera (P = 0.041), Bacillus (P = 0.047), and Rothia (P = 0.047) genera were evident. Of these genera, some contain species capable of opportunistic, anaerobic infections of the respiratory tract. The stool microbiome showed no significant differences in bacterial load between participants (P = 0.131) or sampling month (P = 0.867), but bacterial diversity was significantly (P < 0.001) different between participants. Stool water content (P < 0.001), pH of raw saliva (P < 0.001), and saliva supernatant (P = 0.001) all showed significant differences between participants. Overall, the human microbiome shows a spatially different response to the stresses of extreme physiological and environmental conditions, which may have important implications for prolonged human space travel.",

This analysis is performed for small population of the Svalbard reindeer from Hornsund fjord (10 individuals), which is almost uninhabited by humans. In most of performed studies, samples for bacterial taxonomic identification are taken from rumen, which often implicates the death of the animal or at least a very stressful situation. That kind of practice during sampling provide trucking changes over time e.g. accordingly to seasonal food changes or ecological changes, it often makes experiment more expensive, time consuming, and uncomfortable for subject of studies. It also interferes in natural animal environment especially when thinking about natural populations, almost untouched by humans.

    "description": "Algae are important primary colonizers of snow and glacial ice, but hitherto little is known about their ecology on Iceland’s glaciers and ice caps. Due do the close proximity of active volcanoes delivering large amounts of ash and dust, they are special ecosystems. This study provides the first investigation of the presence and diversity of microbial communities on all major Icelandic glaciers and ice caps over a three year period. Using high-throughput sequencing of the small subunit ribosomal RNA genes (16S and 18S), we assessed the snow community structure and complemented these analyses with a comprehensive suite of physical-, geo- and biochemical characterizations of the aqueous and solid components contained in snow and ice samples. Our data reveal that a limited number of snow algal taxa (Chloromonas polyptera, Raphidonema sempervirens and two uncultured Chlamydomonadaceae) support a rich community comprising of other micro-eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacterial phyla. Archaea were also detected in sites where snow algae dominated and they mainly belong to the Nitrososphaerales, which are known as important ammonia oxidizers. Multivariate analyses indicated no relationships between nutrient data and microbial community structure. However, the aqueous geochemical simulations suggest that the microbial communities were not nutrient limited because of the equilibrium of snow with the nutrient-rich and fast dissolving volcanic ash. Increasing algal secondary carotenoid contents in the last stages of the melt seasons have previously been associated with a decrease in surface albedo, which in turn could potentially have an impact on the melt rates of Icelandic glaciers.",

To characterize regulatory elements in this species we performed  a genome-wide transcription start site (TSS) profiling and whole-transcript sequencing. TSS were identified by using a differential RNA-seq strategy, based on selective Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (TAP) treatment and adapter ligation, which differentiates primary transcripts and processed RNAs. The accuracy and sensitivity of TSS identification were increased by combining differential RNA-seq analyses under eight conditions corresponding to variations in growth conditions and genetic backgrounds. Whole-transcript sequencing used a two-step adaptor ligation-based directional RNA-seq protocol and was performed under two experimental conditions with triplicate experiments to assess variations in gene expression in response to an acid stress",

    "description": "During the summer months, wet (hyporheic) soils associated with ephemeral streams and lake edges in the Antarctic Dry Valleys (DV) become hotspots of biological activity and are hypothesized to be an important source of carbon and nitrogen for arid DV soils. Recent research in the DV has focused on the geochemistry and microbial ecology of lakes and arid soils, with substantially less information being available on hyporheic soils. Here we determined the unique properties of hyporheic microbial communities, resolved their relationship to environmental parameters and to compared them to archetypal arid DV soils. Generally, pH increased and chlorophyll a concentrations decreased along transects from wet to arid soils (9.0 to ~7.0 for pH and ~0.8 to ~ 5 µg/cm3 for chlorophyll a, respectively). Soil water content decreased to below ~3% in the arid soils. Community fingerprinting-based principle component analyses revealed that bacterial communities formed distinct clusters specific to arid and wet soils; however, eukaryotic communities that clustered together did not have similar soil moisture content nor did they group together based on sampling location. Collectively, rRNA pyrosequencing indicated a considerably higher abundance of Cyanobacteria in wet soils and a higher abundance of Acidobacterial, Actinobacterial, Deinococcus/Thermus, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospira and Planctomycetes in arid soils. The two most significant differences at the genus level were Gillisia signatures present in arid soils and chloroplast signatures related to Streptophyta that were common in wet soils. Fungal dominance was observed in arid soils and Viridplantae were more common in wet soils. This research represents an in-depth characterization of microbial communities inhabiting wet DV soils. Results indicate that the repeated wetting of hyporheic zones has a profound impact on the bacterial and eukaryotic communities inhabiting in these areas.",

Despite this, little is known about seasonal changes in the active microbial community within arctic soil systems. We studied seasonal variation in the bacterial community by co-extracting DNA and RNA from 12 active layer soil cores from Svalbard, Norway, collected monthly over a year. 16S rRNA genes at the DNA and RNA levels were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq technology and analyzed using QIIME. Multivariate statistical analysis of the bacterial diversity data showed distinct seasonal changes in the community at DNA as well as RNA level. It was observed that the relative abundance of presumably active Alphaproteobacteria increased over the summer and then dropped from October to November; and at the same time the relative abundance of presumably active Acidobacteria increased. Analysis of the bacterial community structure and physico-chemical parameters of the soil samples revealed that the bacterial community structure at the DNA level was significantly correlated with pH, soil water content. The community structure at the RNA level was significantly correlated with dissolved organic nitrogen, pH. In conclusion, the structure of the bacterial community in Svalbard active layer showed seasonal variation and was controlled by changes in pH and soil nutrient contents. presumably representing the active part of the community; e.g. the June RNA sample was dominated by Cyanobacteria.",

The influence of bacterial-associated fatty acids and polysaccharides is inferred, underlining the importance of bacterial community structure in the properties of cryoconite. Thus, combined application of T-RFLP and FT-IR metabolite fingerprinting promise high throughput and hence, rapid assessment of community structure-function relationships. Pyrosequencing revealed Proteobacteria are particularly abundant, with Cyanobacteria likely acting as ecosystem engineers in both Alpine and Arctic cryoconite communities. However, despite these generalities, very significant differences in bacterial community structures, compositions and metabolomes are found between Alpine and Arctic cryoconite habitats, reflecting the impact of local and regional conditions on the challenges of thriving in glacial ecosystems.",

    "description": "Dormant Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli play important role in latent tuberculosis infection. Previously we have demonstrated that cultivation of M. tuberculosis in potassium-deficient media resulted in the generation of dormant ‘non-culturable’ cells. Addition of a moderate concentration of rifampicin enabled to kill a minor subpopulation of actively replicating bacilli and obtain a homogeneous ‘zero-CFU’ population of dormant cells characterized by total inability to produce colonies on solid media and by high potential to reactivate after reintroducing of potassium. An RNA-seq based transcriptome analysis of this dormant ‘zero-CFU’ population revealed a 30-50 fold decrease of the total level of mRNA in the cells, indicating global shift-down of gene expression level. The residual scarce protein-coding transcriptome of the dormant cells showed decreased abundance of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and enzymes of TCA cycle and respiratory chain, and increased abundance of mRNAs encoding PE-PGRS proteins. Interestingly, the transcriptome of dormant cells showed little changes during several days of persistence. This stability of ‘dormant’ transcripts may reflect their readiness for translation upon resuscitation process. Transition of M. tuberculosis cells to dormancy was accompanied by the cleavage of 23S ribosomal RNA at a specific point, located outside the ribosome catalytic center. Another feature of the ‘dormant’ transcriptome was an increased abundance of non-coding transcripts. Enrichment of \"dormant transcriptome\" by small non-coding RNAs playing regulatory function in the cell probably indicates their role in transition to and maintenance of dormant ‘non-culturable’ state. Overall design: Twelve samples, representing Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv cells at various time points in the model of dormancy: \"Log\", \"DE\", \"DM\" and \"DL\". Each of the the time points is represented by three independently sequenced biological replicates.",

    "description": "Planktonic bacteria play key role in biogeochemical cycles and energy                 flow in marine ecosystems. However, our knowledge of the extent and character of                 bacterial diversity in polar marine environments is still limited. Here we present                 the use of high throughput DNA pyrosequencing and statistical inference to assess                 the diversity of planktonic bacteria in the arctic Canada Basin, and Kongsfjorden in                 Spitsbergen. The V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified from seawater samples                 collected from the upper water column. The number of bacterial 16S rRNA sequences                 obtained from each sites varied from 7433 to 9218. In the Canada Basin, the most                 abundant bacterial groups in two sites of water at 10m depth were the Proteobacteria                 (mainly Alphaproteobacteria), Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria.                 Different bacterial communities were observed in the deeper water (80 or 100m depth)                 at the two sites. The Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes also formed the dominant                 bacterial groups in surface water of Kongsfjorden. However, Gammaproteobacteria                 accounted for more than 90% of the Proteobacteria.",

    "description": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) depends on protein secretion systems for intracellular survival and virulence. The major virulence determinant and ESX-1 dependent effector protein EsxA causes tissue damage and necrosis which promotes spread and dissemination of the bacterium. We developed a fibroblast survival assay (FSA) that exploits this phenotype by selecting for molecules that protect host cells from Mtb-induced lysis. Hit compounds identified in this high-throughput screen blocked the secretion of EsxA thus promoting phagosome maturation which led to substantially reduced bacterial burden in activated macrophages. Target identification studies performed on these drugs led to discovery of a benzothiophene containing histidine kinase inhibitor and a benzyloxybenzylidine hydrazine compound affecting mycobacterial metal ion homeostasis which enabled us to reveal zinc stress as a signal for EsxA secretion. Collectively, this novel drug screening approach can help to tackle the mounting problem of antibiotic-resistant mycobacteria by largely extending the target spectrum of small molecule libraries.

    "description": "Microbial communities have a key role in the physiology of the sponge host, and it is therefore essential to understand the stability and specificity of sponge–symbiont associations. Host-specific bacterial associations spanning large geographic distance are widely acknowledged in sponges. However, the full spectrum of specificity remains unclear. In particular, it is not known whether closely related sponges host similar or very different microbiota over wide bathymetric and geographic gradients, and whether specific associations extend to the rare members of the sponge microbiome. Using the ultra-deep Illumina sequencing technology, we conducted a comparison of sponge bacterial communities in seven closely related Hexadella species with a well-resolved host phylogeny, as well as of a distantly related sponge Mycale. These samples spanned unprecedentedly large bathymetric (15–960 m) gradients and varying European locations. In addition, this study included a bacterial community analysis of the local background seawater for both Mycale and the widespread deep-sea taxa Hexadella cf. dedritifera. We observed a striking diversity of microbes associated with the sponges, spanning 47 bacterial phyla. The data did not reveal any Hexadella microbiota co-speciation pattern, but confirmed sponge-specific and species-specific host–bacteria associations, even within extremely low abundant taxa. Oligotyping analysis also revealed differential enrichment preferences of closely related Nitrospira members in closely related sponges species. Overall, these results demonstrate highly diverse, remarkably specific and stable sponge–bacteria associations that extend to members of the rare biosphere at a very fine phylogenetic scale, over significant geographic and bathymetric gradients.",

    "description": "The classic view of polar ocean foodwebs emphasizes large predators sustained by energy and materials flow through short, efficient diatom-krill-predator food chains. Bacterial activity is generally low in cold polar waters compared to lower latitudes. This view appears to be changing, with new studies of microbial foodwebs in Arctic and Antarctic oceans. We characterized bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic community diversity and composition from two depths (near surface and below the euphotic zone) at four sites, including the inshore and offshore, and north and south corners of a sampling grid along the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). We detected up to 2-fold higher richness in microbial eukaryotes at surface and deep inshore northern stations as compared to southern ones but offshore northern and southern stations revealed either no trend or higher richness at depth in the south. In contrast, bacterial and archaeal richness showed no significant differences either inshore or offshore at northern versus southern extents but did vary with depth. Archaea were virtually absent in summer surface waters but were present in summer deep and winter surface samples. Overall, winter bacterial and archaeal assemblages most closely resembled summer sub-euphotic zone assemblages, reflecting well-established seasonal patterns of water column turnover and stratification that result in an isolated layer of “winter water” below the euphotic zone. Inter-domain heterotroph-phototroph interactions were evident from network analysis. The WAP is among the most rapidly warming regions on earth.

    "description": "The PhoPR two-component system is essential for virulence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis where it controls expression of approximately 2% of the genes, including those for the ESX-1 secretion apparatus, a major virulence determinant. Mutations in phoP lead to compromised production of pathogen-specific cell wall components and attenuation both ex vivo and in vivo. Using antibodies against the native protein in ChIP-seq experiments (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing) we demonstrated that PhoP binds to at least 35 loci on the M. tuberculosis genome. The PhoP regulon comprises several transcriptional regulators as well as genes for polyketide synthases and PE/PPE proteins. Integration of ChIP-seq results with high-resolution transcriptomic analysis (RNA-seq) revealed that PhoP controls 30 genes directly, whilst regulatory cascades are responsible for signal amplification and downstream effects. The most prominent site of PhoP regulation was located in the intergenic region between rv2395 and PE_PGRS41, where the mcr7 gene codes for a small non-coding RNA (ncRNA). Northern blot experiments confirmed the absence of Mcr7 in the M. tuberculosis phoP mutant as well as low-level expression of the ncRNA in M. tuberculosis complex members other than M. tuberculosis. By means of genetic and proteomic analyses we demonstrated that Mcr7 modulates translation of the tatC mRNA thereby impacting the activity of the Twin Arginine Translocation (Tat) protein secretion apparatus. As a result, secretion of the immunodominant Ag85 complex and the beta-lactamase BlaC is affected, among others. Mcr7, the first ncRNA of M. tuberculosis whose function has been established, therefore represents a missing link between the PhoPR two-component system and the downstream functions necessary for successful infection of the host.

Four water samples of melting ponds (MP1 to MP4) and an ice core were collected from the sea-ice station (Fig. S1). The water samples were also filtered using both 3- and 0.2-μm pore membrane filters. The sea-ice core (103 cm) was cut into two parts, ice-top (IT1+IT2: 41 cm) and ice-bottom (IB: 61 cm). Both of the ice core parts were separately melted after peeling off a thin layer from the surface of the whole ice core using a sterile knife for decontamination, and then respectively filtered. The 0.2-μm pore-sized membranes were stored in a deep-freezer (– 80°C) equipped in the ARAON and transported back to the laboratory on ice for DNA extraction.",

High-resolution transcriptome analysis identified the transcription start points for 652 genes. One third of these coincided with the start codons and therefore belong to leaderless transcripts, whereas the rest of the transcripts had 5' UTRs with the mean length of 83 nt. In addition, the 5' UTRs of 6 genes contained SAM-IV and Ykok types of riboswitches. 87 antisense RNAs and 9 intergenic small RNAs were mapped. Four of the revealed intergenic small RNAs, including igMAV_1034-1035 expressed at a very high level, have no homologs in M. tuberculosis, whilst M. avium lacks several intergenic sRNAs present in M. tuberculosis. Among those, MTS479 and MTS1338 are of special interest due to their possible implication in pathogenesis. Elucidation of differences in the repertoire of intergenic sRNAs between the two mycobacterial species may improve our understanding of mycobacterial diseases pathogenesis.

    "description": "Since nitrogen (N) is often limiting in permafrost soils, we investigated the N2-fixing genetic potential and the inferred taxa harboring those genes by sequencing nifH gene fragments in samples taken along a permafrost thaw gradient in an Alaskan boreal soil. Samples from minimally, moderately and extensively thawed sites were taken to a depth of 79 cm to encompass zones above and below current thaw depths. NifH reads were translated with frameshift correction and 112,476 sequences were clustered at 5% amino acid dissimilarity resulting in 1,631 OTUs.  Representative sequences of each cluster linked to the nearest neighbor produced 123 unique reference database matches. Sample depth in relation to thaw depth rather than extent of thaw showed differences in the NifH sequence classes. NifH sequences most closely related to group I nifH-harboring Alpha- and Beta Proteobacteria were in higher abundance above thaw depth while those related to group III nifH-harboring Delta Proteobacteria were more abundant below thaw depth. Overall, these results suggest that permafrost thawing will result in changes in the class-level composition of N2-fixing communities in the thawed soil layers. These nifH data were also compared to nifH sequences obtained from a previous study at an Alaskan taiga site, and to those of other geographically distant, non-permafrost sites. The two AK sites were differentiated largely by changes in relative abundances of the same OTUs, whereas the non-Alaska sites were differentiated by the lack of many Alaskan OTUs, and the presence of unique halophilic, sulfate- and iron-reducing taxa in the Alaska sites.",

    "description": "Soil fungi play a major role in terrestrial ecosystem functioning through interactions with soil structure, plants, micro- and mesofauna and nutrient cycling through predation, pathogenesis, mutualistic and saprotrophic roles. The diversity of soil fungi was assessed by sequencing their 28S rRNA gene in Alaskan permafrost and Oklahoma tallgrass prairie soils at experimental sites where the effect of climate warming is under investigation. A total of 226,695 reads were classified into 1063 genera, covering 62% of the reference dataset. Using the Bayesian Classifier offered by RDP with 50% bootstrapping classification confidence, approximately 70% of sequences remained unclassified at the genus level, although the majority (~65%) were successfully classified at the class level, which provided insight into these lesser-known fungal lineages. Compared to the more abundant sequences, a higher proportion of rare OTUs were successfully classified to genera at 50% bootstrap, indicating that the fungal rare biosphere is not composed of sequencing artifacts. There was no significant effect of warming on the fungal community structure, except perhaps for a few minor members, but there was a significant effect of sample depth in the permafrost soils. Shallow fungal communities were largely shaped by plant influences, with abundant OTUs identified as putative endophytes or pathogens. Alaskan soil alpha diversity was nearly covered by the sequencing effort. Despite overall significant community structure differences driven by variations in OTU dominance, the prairie and permafrost soils shared 90% and 63% of all fungal sequences, respectively, indicating a fungal “seed bank” common between both sites.",

    "description": "Snow environments can occupy over a third of land surface area, but little is known about the dynamics of snowpack bacteria. The effect of snow melt on bacterial community structure and diversity of surface environments of a Svalbard glacier was examined using analyses of 16S rRNA genes via T-RFLP, qPCR and 454 pyrosequencing. Distinct community structures were found in different habitat types, with changes over 1 week apparent, in particular for the dominant bacterial class present, Betaproteobacteria. The differences observed were consistent with influences from depositional mode (snowfall vs aeolian dusts), contrasting snow with dust-rich snow layers and near-surface ice. Contrary to that, slush as the decompositional product of snow harboured distinct lineages of bacteria, further implying post-depositional changes in community structure. Taxa affiliated to the betaproteobacterial genus Polaromonas were particularly dynamic, and evidence for the presence of betaproteobacterial ammonia-oxidizing bacteria was uncovered, inviting the prospect that the dynamic bacterial communities associated with snowpacks may be active in supraglacial nitrogen cycling and capable of rapid responses to changes induced by snowmelt. Furthermore the potential of supraglacial snowpack ecosystems to respond to transient yet spatially extensive melting episodes such as that observed across most of Greenland’s ice sheet in 2012 merits further investigation.",

    "title": "Marine bacteria exhibit a bipolar distribution.",
    "description": "The microbial cosmopolitan dispersion hypothesis often invoked to explain distribution patterns driven by high-connectivity of oceanographic water masses and widespread dispersal ability has never been rigorously tested. Using a global marine bacterial dataset and iterative matrix randomization simulation, we show that marine bacteria exhibit a significantly greater dispersal limitation than predicted by our null model employing the \"Everything is everywhere\" with no dispersal limitation scenario. Specifically, marine bacteria displayed bipolar distributions (species occurring exclusively at both poles and nowhere else) significantly less often than in the null model. Furthermore, we observed fewer taxa present in both hemispheres but more taxa present only in a single hemisphere than expected under the null model. Each of these trends diverged further from the null expectation as the compared habitats became more geographically distant but more environmentally similar. Our meta-analysis supported a latitudinal gradient in bacterial diversity with higher richness at lower latitudes, but decreased richness toward the poles. Bacteria in the tropics also demonstrated narrower latitudinal ranges at lower latitudes and relatively larger ranges in higher latitudes, conforming to the controversial macroecological pattern of \"Rapoport's rule\". Collectively, our findings suggest that bacteria follow biogeographic patterns more typical of macroscopic organisms and that dispersal limitation, not just environmental selection, likely plays an important role. Distributions of microbes that deliver critical ecosystem services, particularly those in polar regions, may be vulnerable to the same impacts that environmental stressors, climate warming, and degradation in habitat quality are having on biodiversity in animal and plant species.

    "title": "Arctic LTER",
    "description": "The long-term goal of the Arctic LTER research program is to predict the effects of climate change on the Arctic system at catchment and landscape scales through knowledge of the linkages and interactions among ecosystems. The MIRADA program provides a new opportunity to assess the diversity of aquatic microbes at the Arctic LTER site in more depth. Sampling was designed to answer two basic questions about spatial and short-term temporal patterns in microbial diversity. * How do microbial communities vary in winter vs. summer in Toolik Lake, and which taxa of Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya characterize these periods? * What are the sources of microbial diversity in surface waters? Specifically, how do riparian soil waters and stream hyporheic zones contribute to diversity in surface waters? Because lakes are the primary reservoirs of planktonic microbes in the Arctic LTER system, we sampled the epilimnion and hypolimnion of Toolik Lake during winter and summer. These samples were collected through the ice in May, 2008 and from a boat in July, 2008. To address questions concerning the importance of sources of diversity on the landscape we sampled (1) the primary inlet to Toolik Lake (Toolik Inlet) that drains more than 70% of the Toolik catchment, (2) hyporheic water below the rocky bed of Toolik Inlet stream, (3) soil water drawn from ~10-20 centimeters below the surface of soils near the bank of Toolik inlet, and (4) water from I-8 Inlet, which is a stream that is not influenced by upstream lakes. Conclusions thus far include: * Tag pyrosequencing results mirror what is seen with DGGE approaches. * Lake Bacteria and Eukarya communities are similar year-round, but distinct taxa dominate in different seasons. * Lakes contain the lowest bacterial diversity * Lake-less streams contain highest bacterial diversity * Dispersal is high across the landscape, and upslope communities inoculate downslope environments. Analysis of these samples will provide new insight into the composition of microbial communities at the Arctic LTER research site, the sources of diversity for surface waters, and into temporal and spatial patterns in microbial diversity.",
